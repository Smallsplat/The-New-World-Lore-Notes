• Assassin hunt
> Assassin is killing individuals and leaving them a calling card and leaving the body to be found.
> > A golden coin with a symbol of a deer's skull is placed on the victims tounge
> Is killing high value traders of the Ebonstar who are actively trying to monopolise out local stores by abusing the kindess and lower oversight of the Kolective


#### Crime scene Clues:
• The Shopkeeper:
> Clearly not born in the kolective - an Ebonstar Native
> The coin seems to be hand-crafted with legitimate metals - maybe there's a way to track imports of raw gold and silver?

• The Shop
> Un-notable goods at lower prices, of same quality as anything else found
> Seems to be in the middle of town, unsuspecting or indifferent to any other store

• The Method
> No physical wounds
> Seems to be psychic damage - Doesn't seem to be a common spell - maybe someone could have crafted something specific? 
> A paralysis was used to reduce the individuals ability to respond - maybe an alchemist would know of any commissions to make something this strong? 

Alchemist know of some strong grade stuff requested by someone on a guild bounty who needed strong paralysis to neutralise a [Great Grodair](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1637) as to not kill it and return it to the fey wilds. Due to the creatures incredible fortitude, the elixir was incredibly strong but far from lethal. 

The local arcane resource station has a ton of regulars who remember working on a custom spell for an individual that seemed like a fun project - remove all chance and randomness for perfect mental damage. The spell they made felt more like a proof of concept than anything useable - anyone awake, even one unknown to the arcane, would be able to resist the spell without much effort, and the spell was incredibly inefficient compared to other spells of its arcane level

The dock ledger will point the players to an run-down smithty in the outer city, anyone nearby will mention its been run down for a while buy isn't up for re-evaluation for a few months as there's no proof the owner isn't dead and the rents been paid far in advance. 

Hidden in the basement is the collection of hostile, racist conspiracists. almost identical wears are labed "Kolective" and "foreign" - manifestos about how outsiders are still to be distrusted and those trying to sell their wares here are here to dismantle the kolective from the inside. Insane, vile nonsence. A map of the city can be found, with marks of the previous assassinations, and a new mark - a shopkeep the players visited earlier who was still alive....
