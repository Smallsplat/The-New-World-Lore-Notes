The Kolective stands as an alliance comprising individual nations scattered across the southern peninsulas and islands. Their belief centres around an event known as 'The Enlightening,' during which every minor landmass experienced a simultaneous renaissance of civilization and culture. This union was not forged easily; it required years of negotiations and internal conflicts among the isles, their unity strengthened by the looming threat of external forces eager to expand their territories.

The majority of Kolective's population comprises what they refer to as "Beast Tribes," often bearing a striking resemblance to well-known feral creatures. They hold reverence for the Gods of Nature, a sentiment that comes as no surprise given their reliance on boats and the abundant resources of their small isles.

Their desire to claim the island stems from its strategic location, nearly equidistant from the major cities of the empire. It would serve as a symbol of peace and unity within the Kolective. Furthermore, it represents a unique opportunity, as it's the only unoccupied land they've encountered. As the youngest empire on the planet at present, they see it as just and fair to secure the Isles for themselves, particularly after repeated attempts by other empires to seize their own territory.
