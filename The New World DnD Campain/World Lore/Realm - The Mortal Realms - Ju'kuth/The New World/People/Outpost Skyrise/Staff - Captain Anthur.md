Captain Anthur Thorne, the old yet dexterous human known affectionately as "Saltbeard," is a weathered and grizzled old sea captain from the syndicate with deep and long-lasting ties with the guild. He's seen everything and anything and can tell a story about some crazy event he’s lived through or survived. In turn, he's one of the guilds and in turn, the world's most beloved figure that everyone seems to know, and if he can he’ll join in a battle with the most insane battle strategies and surprise attacks that are shockingly effective.
