Professor Bigglewiz will inform the players about:
• the plants crippling weakness to mythril.  
• excited about being granted a dungeon class laboratory 
• Will be blantent about his moral compass. Good guys spend all their money on adventures stopping bad guys, so all the rich people are bad guys finding their plans or adventures! 
• Way to open about how much having a dungeon class bounty will help buisness even if his labratory got wrecked

• Will eagerly share his findings on curses:
> Curses are just magic that are self-sufficient magical effects 
> Ebonstar pirates are frequently werewolves for the curse's physical resistance benefits with a weakness to specifically only silver or magic weapons, which are a rarity on most trade ships
> This has lead to an attempt to try and grand a more general resistance curse, and hes trying to find the price the curse can thrive off of that wouldn't render the effect meaningless. Right now he both removed the resistances and made them extra weak to mithril. Apparently the more common a resource is, the easier it is to create a resistance to it.
> He ponders that if he could get a resource that was both incredibly common yet hard to obtain that would meld easily to curses, being weak to that resource would be worth it. 

If Izumi talks about their curse:
> If Remove curse did not work, them it means that she is not cursed, but there is a curse on the land or things around her that is targeting her by the nature of the spell. Like cursing a towns bakers for selling stale bread by hiding the curse sigil at the bottom of a well. 
> Will be deeply interested in learning more, as something or someone must have been deeply convicted to create a curse in the first place, especially one that would target an individual
