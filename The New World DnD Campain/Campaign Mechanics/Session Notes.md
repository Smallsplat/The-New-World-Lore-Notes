## General Notes - Session 1

Both squads have arrived at the New World and have been given the Tour of Outpost Skyrise! Arriving by Wingdrake or Boat, they were greeted on landing by Commander Highturner and Amathist, the officers of the Outpost, and given a tour of the settlement.  
  
They met the Blacksmith Ironbeard, the hulking tiefling that commands the smithies and offered to use the resources and opportunities the roamers find out in the island to create new, custom gear. In the tavern is the Half-elf  Mother Tyreen and her Kobolods, supplying the outpost with daily meals, and has requested to hunt for other edibles out on the island to expand her catering options. And in the lower levels of the Infocade, Professor Magiscale, the lizardkin and an eccentric ball of scales obsessed with hoarding knowledge has offered to share his collection to help the roamers on their escapades.

Their tour ended with meeting the Envoys of all three major empires, the Kolective represented by the calm and collected Minotaur Elysia, the Syndicate represented by upbeat Teifling Vaelin, and the Tomebound represented by a tall, untalkative elf.  

Their dismissal and privacy of the envoys let the officers Amathyst and Highcommander be blunt about the stakes of this expedition. Wars over territory are frequent and repetitive over the long course of history, and he expects this island to be no different. It just takes a missive from an empire and a few quick assassinations for a full-scale war to break out, thousands of lives to be lost on the battlefield and the secrets this island lost to pillaging and looting. 

This also raised the point of the previous roamers, who disappeared without a trace, and in turn employed the presence of the Guides, Charlie and Scotch, whose sole responsibility is to note take and keep track of the roamer's locations in case of emergencies so an entire party of people don’t disappear off the map... again…

## General Notes - Session 2

After the briefing, both squads were dismissed for the day to rest and prepare for their roam tomorrow. The Saturday squad chose the Brevacus, an oversized beaver, whereas the Sunday crew are on the hunt for the Hedgehog, a chunky spikey hedgehog! 

Seeking advice from the officers, both squads sought out Professor Magiscale to do some initial planning and to better know their quarries, both with reasonable success. One squad found themselves trading for information and seeking out the professor's assistance in exploring their combat prowess, while the others sought out the blacksmiths to discover ways to capture the beasts.

A major direction split was how the parties got to know each other. While the Saturday squad used a regenerating plant dummy to shoot and showcase their spells and Combat abilities, the Sunday squad used each other's bodies. While the Saturday squad used a signature ability to showcase their fighting style, the Sunday squad blinded, shot, coerced, used biochemical warfare and transformed their way into a beat down for the grand prize of… choosing who picks beds first! 

This brawl ended with Keth victorious, who attacked nobody in the battle and healed their way to first place, choosing the closest bed at the time, while Shuvu came last, who did well in the battle but could not convince the others she was actually as okay as she was. Meanwhile, the Saturday squad were bonding over ice sculptures, scouting the views and discussing their thoughts on the other denizens of the outpost before both squads finally bedded for the night. 

---
## General Notes - Session 3

These sessions were fairly similar, with both squads getting equipped with the flair gun, a days worth of food and the scrying rings, each talking to their appropriate person twho would have each tool. After being officially dismissed by the Officers, the Sunday squad ran into ELysra, the Mintoraur Envoy of the Kolective, who joined them having nothing better to do and just generally excited about things starting again to collect the sleep bombs and walked them to the gate.  
  
While saturdays squad stops here, the Sunday squad went out of their hunt! Learning about the plains and tracking down the Brevacus to its lair, a forest’s graveyard of sawdust and fallen trees, and while they were far from stealthy in their approach, a Natural 1 saw the breavacus fast asleep, unaware of their presence, letting them get the jump in the upcoming battle…

---
## General Notes - Session 4

The Saturday squad found themselves up against the Breavacus and, to be blunt, kicked its ass. Getting the jump on the boy and getting a free round let them split up against the beast’s attacks, who was forced to choose one or the other. Hills wings allowing flight helped navigate this wooden graveyard of a battlefield and shut the Breavacus down before its ability to turn trees into breath attacks could do some serious damage with a well-placed magic sleep bomb. 

On the other hand, the Sunday squad used Locate Animal and Plants and walked in a straight line to their hunt, using Felis’s ability to transform into different beats to climb a sheer cliff face using a spider web, much to Kurt's general disgust and desire to find a way to just use a rope. The actual battle was a lot tenser, with the Hedgebog getting the jump on the group with Shuvu’s constitution finding themselves seeing quadruple and nearly falling in battle, and the Hedgebog using its quills to try and defend itself, and was also captured.

The squad's attention post-battle took different approaches. As Hill and Dandelion scoured the area for clues or loot, and stumbled upon a ruined abandoned toll building. Anything that could rot, had, and the entire building had mostly been claimed by nature. In turn, a toll building tolls a road, and a clear pathway cut through the forest leads north, where, after re-grouping with Thalina and a natural 20, 4 figures were spotted for a brief moment.

While Kurt and Felis scoured for additional traps laid by the hedgehog, Shuvu and Keth in turn looked into the beasts themselves, and with another natural 20, attuned to the beast's arcana and were washed with this alien and unnatural feeling arcana from any realm they know…

---
## General Notes - Session 5

(Session 4 stuff I missed) The Saturday squad had arrived at the outpost hours before the Sunday squad and debriefed with the officers, informing the outpost of the other figures and triggering a headcount and announcement, with everyone grouping at the Infocade. Dismissed for the night, they settled down for bed before being distracted by Thalina and her wing-drakes taking off to go collect the other squad.  
  
(Session 5 actual) United, the two squads discussed pleasantries, greetings, and sharing some inside jokes before heading up the infocade to meet with their guides. After an incredibly rough and wild explanation of their hunts, the guides gave a rundown of all the new information, along with trying to reinforce faith in the outpost, despite the seeming chaos that spawned after their hunts on their second day here. 

---

Suggesting a rest, the squad let the guides brief the officers, stole Mother Tyreen and took off to the tavern, where they ran into Magiscale studying the beasts. Hill, Dandelion and Keth stayed to discuss while the rest got grub, where Keth raised the comment about the beast not feeling from Ji’kuth as a whole and feeling… alien, and, after the discussion about magic in general and a second attempt with better guidance, Hill also clued into the alien-feeling arcana.

This meeting of the minds changed to a sharp tonal change as Dandelion insulted Magiscale, who became visibly upset, and the other members' attempts to reconcile with the wizard failed, the discussion ending as he politely suggested they left for food. Mother Tyreen, showing why she earned that title, clued into the party’s general distress immediately and did her best to help them work through it.  

A night later, fully rested and with a belly full of breakfast, our adventures joined in an argument between the Amathyst and Magiscale about what to do with the beasts. Magiscale insisted on trying and banishing the creatures to prove his theory that “Luminae”, a realm entirely from children's fiction, actually exists and these beats came here, despite refusing to explain his reasoning outside “A departed friend research”, whereas Amathyst wanted to release the beasts back into the wilds like any reasonable person.

After discussion, Magiscale attempted a banishment spell, which failed outright… so he cast it as a much, much higher level successfully! The beast permanently disappeared, confirming the theory that they are not from this realm, but, their general resistance to being banished made Magiscale concerned about tracking where they got banished to, and thus the hedgehog remained in camp for additional research.

Ironbeard, wondering what caused the roamer's delay and not wanting to cause even more of a fuss, stole our squad members away from this to talk upgrades based on what they could salvage from the beasts. After a long discussion about utility and benefits was about to conclude, a wave of raw arcana rushed through the camp, the smithies flames engulfing the players… and ending the session 

---
## General Notes - Session 6

The aftermath of the arcane blast split our parties again. While both squads helped try to deduce the source arcane wave, the approach to the situation’s urgency was starkly different. The Sunday squad took their time to recuperate, speculate and research both the source and their next steps. The Saturday squad on the other hand were all hands on deck, ensuring everyone's safety and went straight to be briefed.

Both squads were assigned to scour the island coasts. With the news of there being other people on the island, the officers assigned the roamers to scout the coastlines of the southern isle. Due to the sheer distance of the isle from any other landmass, a vessel of some sort must have been used to land on the island, and the roamers’ job is to find it.

Saturday squad in their haste headed straight to the western coastline, but embarked on a slight detour when the sounds of a turf war between two greater beasts was overheard… where they found mightier beasts in the woods than they expected…

---
## General Notes - Session 7

After surviving their encounter deep in the woods, the saturday squad caught their breath before heading to their starting point. Before they could even get there however, a loud crash ocean side would take full attention. A cargo ship had ruptured and crashed into shore, with people in full plate scrambling to escape the tide. Upon rushing out to help, the party was suddenly attacked… but a stowaway onboard helped defend the party! This brutal fight saw Kurt fall but ended victorious, the paladins killed, and the stowaway, a Kenku called Drop, spared and recruited to the party until the officers decide their fate.

The sunday squad, equipped for their adventure, took to the eastern cliffs. Enhanced by Felis’s ability to transform to move at double speed, they managed to reach the start of their search border with full daylight. The thin cliff path lead them to finding and tracking down a large, currently unnamed lizard, with the ability to call for reinforcmenets! After it nearly killed Shuvu and a heavy amount of panic, some well placed blows to knocked the beast and its companions out.

---
## General Notes - Session 8

With time to burn until sundown, the Saturday crew work together to settle in the remains of the ship. A campfire was made, a makeshift rope navigate the ship floors and the local crates looted, the Woodcutter daggers forged from the teeth of the breavacus making it light work. Discovering a strange tablet depicting symbols of the 5 planes of structure and a Statue of the Godess Rani, the crew settle down around the campfire and connect before a well-deserved rest. 

After a short rest to nurse their wounds, the sunday squad continues their scout of the eastern cliffline. The clear waves and windswept cliffs proved very little interest outside of its natural beauty, until a small, hidden cave revealed a small bounty of unique berries! After scouring for additional supplies to last the night, a sudden surprise visit from a familiar face left the night with many questions and even more confusion. 

---
## General Notes - Session 9

A new dawn saw the squads continue their adventures, with the Saturday crew scrounging up any last supplies from the shipwreck, and the Sunday crew enjoying the calming cliffs and open sea on the outer edges on this wild isle, interrupted by an early morning conversation with their guides, sharing news about the events back at base.

The news of the Rani paladin attacks, claiming the Saturday squad of being assistant to the crimes of the Archmage Maliketh, was quickly overshadowed by the introduction of a Second Magiscale who claimed to be from “A different dimension” who was adamant about the basecamp’s magiscale not knowing about them… which Charlie immediately broke. This lead to Elara, The Tomebound envoy immediately starting an argument with Commander Highturner about Magiscale clearly breaching the outpost rules.

This caused the guides to be split apart and put into the envoys offices while the observation deck is used to have an official discussion with all the guides while our adventurer's continue their scouting. It was the saturdays squad to find some unique plants, only to release too late it was being used as bait for some crafty beasts, leading to a brutal fight where they came so close to losing one of their own. Sunday crew, however, had a fairly uneventful morning, mostly interrupted by any updates Charlie could find and a rather toxic plant.

---
## General Notes - Session 9.5

Nearing the end of their designated coastline checks without any other major incidents, Charlie thought to invite the Sunday squad to explore one of the few anomalies of the previous roamer group discovered before the went missing: a medium sized ship embedded within the ground just south of their location.  After some brief investigations and some theorising about its origin, it became rapidly apparent they weren't the only creatures interested in exploring around here...

---

## General Notes - Session 10

After consolidating the battles previous, both squads were picked up by Thalina at the request of the commanders to resolve the political conflict raised by the presence of a Magiscale outside the outpost boundaries. Elara, the elven envoy of the Tomebound, declared that the agreement made with the Explorer's guild had been breached, and per said agreement, Magiscale must be removed from the island to maintain the equality between Guild and Empire.

After a brief stop at the tavern to recuperate and share the bounty of new fruits they found on their adventures with Tyreen, our roamers were collected by Ironbeard to join the rest of the outpost at the observation deck of the infocade. The last to arrive, they found a spot with their guides to both observe and provide evidence against the accusations. 

Elara opened their arguments with how the presence of Magiscale by the eastern roamers while on their scouting mission clearly broke Outpost Skyrise Agreements by leaving the outpost without permission. This was countered by the fact that this second Magiscale was oblivious to the identities of the roamers, as well as the Guides sharing that immediately after the interaction, they sought out the Magiscale in camp, finding him in the Infocade, oblivious to the happenings, Implying this Magiscale was a separate, identical person. 

This was then pressed by Elara to prove that this Second Magiscale was a clone and not the original, with the only clone spell known to the common spellcaster being the 8th level "Clone" spell. A spell that notably makes an inert empty shell to revive into post-death. This triggered the memory of the Arch-mage Maliketh referenced by the Rani paladins, and his 10th level "Clone Self" spell, a spell that created a clone, including soul, which the roamers pointed out was omitted from Elara's statement. 

Countering this, Elara declared he failed to mention the spell due to the fact the Maliketh documents were missing. An item highly sought after by the elites of the Tomebound due to their academic value, however they were deemed lost after the raid of Maliketh's laboratory. Seeing no other way to be able to defend this argument, Magiscale requested to go "get something", which was approved by the commanders, and returned with those very documents. He declared Maliketh as an old friend, and refused to allow Maliketh's work to become a collectors item to be bartered with, rescuing the documents before the laboratory raid.

The reveal of this information took everyone off guard, no more than Elara themselves. After composing themselves, Elara stated that on the extremely rare chance Magiscale was able to cast the spell, (being Arch-mages being extremely rare and typically publicly known), not declaring such an event was, if nothing else, extreme negligence. 

Magiscale explained that he felt no need to declare the fact he cast the spell because he had no reason to believe it worked. Upon the spells conclusion, the clone disappeared instantaneously the same way any other spell without the appropriate arcane funding would. However, with the recent news, has spent his time since the incident investigating this assumption and has no conclusive evidence to present yet, but agreed it was the most logical conclusion. 

At this point, Keth realised and pointed out that this is an entirely separate accusation, one that would still keep Magiscale within outpost laws. Amathist agreed, and declared the meeting to the over and dismissed everyone. Commander Highturner invited the envoys to stay to discuss the political ramifications of the meeting while Amathist called for Drop, and the roamers who recruited him, to discuss his continued presence on the island. 

Amathist's questions were as blunt as she is and while Drop's answers were not the most specific, complete, or even necessarily helpful to the argument of staying, they were truthful, and he had saved the lives of his fellow roamers more than once in battle. Actions of the present that Amathist valued more than the past. The biggest point of contention, however, was the Steel Defender, a creature Drop knew next to nothing about, yet presented both some degree of sentience and a demand to remain on the island. Amathist suggested that if Drop were to stay, he would need find out the intentions and origin of his companion as soon as possible. 

With all the major meetings resolved, the roamers found themselves dismissed and with hours until sundown, and took off to their own personal quests within the outpost.

• Hill took to the Infocade to hunt for more information within bestiaries to discover more about the creatures they have encountered. While they discovered similar, more well known creatures, nothing about these specific creatures were found... however, an open book on teleportation rune crafting took their attention, which with the help of Drop, they duplicated and studied.

• Dandelion decided to wait for a few hours in Vaelin's office, the envoy of the Syndicate who they knew was keen to deal in Information. After scaring the teifling by jumping out of the shadows and paying the price of a flint-lock shot to the ear, a lengthy conversation to negotiate the trade of knowalge. In exchange for the locations of where Magiscale keeps his most important documents,  Vaelin would try and discover anything he could about the missing roamers. 

• Felis spent his time collecting moss. Felis was happy.

• Kurt delved into discovering anything alchemical upon hearing about the Sunday squads glow berries, eager to find alternative use-cases of their glowing attributes, however struggled to make much progress after finding the outpost's facilities underwhelming at best. 

• Keth and Shuvu took to the tavern to drink away their stresses and discuss the entire Maliketh deal. While Keth knew a bit from the town crier back home, Shuvu shared the story from the point of view as a follower of Phyinitir, sharing how Rani declared these souls created outside the natural life-cycle and  had them hunted, executed, and desecrated them in death, preventing their return to the afterlife. 

As the sun went down, each eventually found their way to their quarters for the night, finding an uneventful night of sleep, with the only curiosity discovered upon waking was the steel defender leaving clues it had left during the night. Where it went or what it did being unknown. 

The morning routines were uneventful with an extremely notable outlier. As Shuvu commenced her daily prayer to her God, Phynitir, she felt the pull of a desired communion stronger than ever. One that was urgent, important, yet not hostile or scared. After much deliberating, she reached out, and wordlessly received the following message: 

"Shuvu. Guider of lost souls. Servant of Phynitir. I bring news of great import. The lands you walk are blind to me, but I know of their origin. They are the root of a story lost to time. Forgotten by mortal men. A story that should not be revived. Not yet."

"I leave you with guidance. Your sister is here. But, I am blind to her position, but she has not graced my scales. A blessing eternal for mortals it is that way, but a bane for your soul. Seek her. Seek the hidden boons within the isle. Return it to its hiding place. Do not let the ancient ward that blinds me fall. We must ALL remain blind."

The message was not all Shuvu received, as upon the vision fading a new trinket hung around her neck, a bone Dreamcatcher with a Pheonix feather caught in its strings, a gift from her mortal god. 

Oblivious to the recent happenings, both squads convened for breakfast, slowly arriving at different times as their routines and rests allowed and were greeted with some new blueprints and menu items from Ironbeard and Tyreen as they exploited the bounty of their explorations.

With the morning formalities out of the way, Scotch requested to pull his squad to somewhere private to discuss matters. Upon arriving at the docks, any conversation that would have struck was interrupted by the Captain Anthur shooting himself out of his ships cannon, landing next to them, healing himself and suggesting they follow him to meet with the commanders...

## General Notes - Session 11/12

Saturday Crew, hereby known as KDHD, followed the Captain up to the commanders table, only to find out it was a projected image, and the actual captain, followed by a new face, would turn up a few moments later. 

The captain shared news from the mainland, how Rani Clerics and Paladins were actively seeking ships to "The Isle of Fantasia", to significant pushback from crews due to the absurdity of the request, however talks with follows of other divinities have seemingly started, and there may be more than just Rani to worry about soon.

This also came with the Introduction of Thunder a 7ft tall, flat chested, armless Female Serval Tabaxi, wearing traditional monk robes, an alchemical belt and followed by two spectral hands. Introducing herself as an alchemist and healer, hired by the captain, she can provide potions and such to the guild, as well as some direct healing if needs be.

Dismissed to discuss the ramifications of the news and further steps, as well as introduce the unexpected new hire, KDHD goes into downtime

Meanwhile, the Sunday crew, now known as the Mossy Boys, take time to discuss the Message Shuvu got from Phynitir. While vague, the message raises some interesting points
• Phynitir knows about the island, but can not see it, and doesn't want to.
• Theres hidden boons on the island
• There's an ancient ward that needs defending
• Shuvu's sister has not died, implying the survival of the missing squad
• The island needs to be returned somewhere it can hide

Taking this to the commanders, they also meet The captain and thunder, share "polite" greetings, and share the message with the commanders. While Amathist generally doesn't trust the gods, this information is too compelling and gives a level of direction to ignore. High tuner agrees, and dismisses the crew as well to deliberate further on what the next steps are.

### Downtime events include:
• Drop gets a quick tour of the outpost with scotch and learned Steely, his automaton, can talk to the wing drakes, much to Thaliana's frustration. In turn, he hunts down more about automatons and assists Dandelion with learning mage hand after seeing Thunders skills with her astral form.

• Kurt continues his studies into the alchemical until hill and Dandi turn up with obvious lies about their success with fishing. he lashes out, confronting her insecurities about the other Magiscale and the general rush to label them as a threat despite a lack of evidence either way. Ending the day with some time to go fishing himself and to talk with Thunder.

• Hill and Dandelion do some fishing with the captain, to some mediocre success. Their plan to do some research in the infocade gets interrupted by Kurts outburst, and in turn takes some time to themselves. They ask Charlie about the one interaction they had with the Magiscale clone, and end the day with a discussion with magiscale about where they stand.

• Dandilion goes fishing with Hill, tries to learn mage hand by himself, and then asks Drop for help trying to learn mage hand together. 

• Keth and Fleis spend most of their day learning to synergise with mounted combat, using Felis's wildshapes as a mount while Keth trying to fling spells and such without impeding Felis's attacks. 

• Shuvu sends all day hunting about ways to survive underground, looking into basic trap making to try and avoid them 

### Final major events
The commanders summon both squads at some point during the afternoon/evening, sharing the information both both meetings and giving their new assignments. Kdhd are to hunt Magiscale 2 to see what his actions are on the island, while The Mossy Boys are on the hunt for this ancient ward. Secondary tasks include seeking the islands Boons and traces of the other squad.

## General Notes - Session 13

The DM, thankful that the parties have split and on separate tasking so these catch up notes can go back to being vague and short again, has the parties set out on their adventure to the northern half of the island.

Both parties awake to the air being dense with unusable arcana causing magical navigation to become difficult and the air to feel heavy, that hill is uniquely immune to for unknown reasons. During breakfast, both parties are given Teleplates, teleportation backpack-styled devises designed to teleport creatures to the outpost before teleporting itself back, designed so creatures can continue being studied while reducing the risk on the wing drakes. 

The mossy boys head to the Eastern part of the ravine, finding a familiar shrine they are still yet to glean information out of, a visit to the ravine, which upon seeing its depth decide to leave to the other crew, given their parties ability to fly, and find a peculiar tree. 

Kdhd take to the western side of the ravine, spending the time to try and find anything of import. A small part split between a turf war and a ravine exploration finds entertainment and some cool rocks respectively. Hills immunity to the arcane energy in the air seems to be causing residual arcane build up, causing her runes to empower outside of spellcasting to the point of discomfort. 

---
### General Notes - Session 14

KDHD take a trip up yet another strange road and upon finding a split, decides to take a short trip down both until someone finds something interesting. Dandi and Hill were the first to find something interesting, a bubble-blowing beast that had made its home in front of some strange ruins, which the rapid reinforcements of Drop and Kurt were able to easily dispatch but unable to capture.

The Mossy Boys found themselves under attack while surrounding this elemental tree, Keth disappearing in thin air, with Shuvu almost following if it wasn't for divine intervention. The attacker escapes with a swapping teleport, switching themselves with a nearby beast to aid in their escape, which the Mossy boys captured with a single casualty thanks to a paladin who couldn't stop critting.

---
### General Notes - Session 15

The Mossy boys adventure to the northern cliffs, finding the rift where the island abruptly stops along with some sweet and enriching ferns. Upon the reports of the other squads discovery, they started heading south until some unknown magical effect sent them to magical sleep in the middle of a creatures territory. 3 exhausting wounds and the beasts defeat later, they flee west to try and find some much, much needed rest 

KDHD take in their surroundings and send their fallen beast back to the camp before finally entering the facility, keeping their back to the door as the explore this unknown building, awakening an unusual being within who may hold some answers if they can help them out.... 

---
### General Notes - Session 16

With the potential for ground breaking information being unlocked yet the sun going down, KDHD explores the facility west towards the dormitories for some rest to tackle both issues in one go. An extensive search of the location finds some minor useful pieces of loot and a message left from the past to the future, a missing companion sends the group into unease before a long nights rest.

After a much needed rest, the Mossy boys continue their search for this northern entrance to this facility, discovering the magical remains of a large-scale battlefield. leaving more questions than answers, and no entrance in sight.

---
### General Notes - Session 17

The Mossy Boys, unable to find an entrance and struggling to find clues, take an hour to escape the stresses and bond with each other, their new companion, and try fishing.... making it so that everyone in this campaign have gone fishing without any prompts. The story teller is bewildered and starts creating a list of tropical fish just in case.
 
KDHD however are determined with the new day to make moves to the Databank to repair their new ally and get potential information. Between avoiding and unusual encounters, their repair begins... awakening creatures deep within the rock to come investigate

---
### General Notes - Session 18

Having fended off the curious, vicious swarm while Drop repaired the databanks, KDHD take the time to rest, celebrate and repair steely. Rested, ready to go, but their main path guarded, they sneak south to explore what other goodies the facility has to offer.

Returning back to the case, the Mossy Boys venture back to the scene to find this northern entrance, where the loud, piercing whines of KDHD's repairs could be heard to guide them. Felis using his wildshape to dig a tunnel in, they stumble their way into the facility themselves and start to explore whatever secrets this side holds...


---
### General Notes - Session 19

Newly equipped with new toys and an earworm in their head, KDHD decide its time to see what they can learn from their newly repaired friend. Barely escaping the predator that guards the caves and a long and deep conversation later, the party leaves the facility with information that would shake the resolve of any priest...
