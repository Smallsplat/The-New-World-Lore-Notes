The Kolective stands as an alliance comprising individual nations scattered across the southern peninsulas and islands. Their belief centres around a vague historical event known as 'The Enlightening,', which legends say is the day that every minor landmass experienced a simultaneous renaissance of civilization and culture. This union was not forged easily; it required years of negotiations and internal conflicts among the isles, their unity strengthened by the looming threat of external forces eager to expand their territories.

The majority of Kolective's population comprises what they refer to as "Beast Tribes," often bearing a striking resemblance to well-known feral creatures. They hold reverence for the Gods of Nature, a sentiment that comes as no surprise given their reliance on boats and the abundant natural resources in their small isles.
#### Infrastructure
A significant amount of the Kolective infrastructure is based around the naval capabilities. Being a collection of small islands and the inability to rely on of fey magic, teleportation circles are rare, only between the biggest cities to be used only sparingly. In turn, most cities are costal with huge dockyards, with all villages on each island having well built roads to these major populator centres.

Most towns are self-sufficient to the point that excess can be easily granted to travellers and visitors, however lodging outside the major population centres are rarely full establishments but communal housing areas designated for visitors

#### Culture
Its hard to pin down the nations culture when every town has its own customs and infrastructure. Towns are typically based around a specific species and have homes and a culture that host them. 

That said, the general population has a general trust of outsiders, with it being hard to discriminate in a country so diverse to not make a majority. Politeness is rewarded in kind, however they are not pushovers. A reminder of the wars to maintain their sovereignty is baked into the lifeblood of the Kolective, with the battlements of war still maintained even if rarely manned. 

Because of the diversity, self-expression has become a huge part of the Kolective social industry, with the magical equivalent of body modifications being uncommon but not abnormal, especially those who live within other cultures or have a wanton desire to be more like other biosocial compatriots  

Custom tailoring and dresswear however are all the rage, with mashups between cultures being a common form of artistry, diplomacy and celebration. 

#### The New World
Their desire to claim the island stems from its strategic location, nearly equidistant from the major cities of the empire. It would serve as a symbol of peace and unity within the Kolective. Furthermore, it represents a unique opportunity, as it's the only unoccupied land they've encountered. As the youngest empire on the planet at present, they see it as just and fair to secure the Isles for themselves, particularly after repeated attempts by other empires to seize their own territory.
