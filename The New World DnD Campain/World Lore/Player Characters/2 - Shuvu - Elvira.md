**Hometown/Dimension:**    Somewhere in Eastern [[Kolective Empire]]

**Description:** 
Shuvu is a purple-ish tiefling with gray hair and gray eyes. They are definitely not very much athlete, but his short height allows him to be quite mobile. His horns are similiar to rams horns, which is quite opposite to all his family having quite long and high ones. 

**Backstory:**
Shuvu spent most of the time helping their mother with ceremonies around Funeral House and Nabis Shrine. It always felt quite fullfiling for them, in opposite to his older sister who was supposed to take main role in his Temple. She was prepared for that since the very beginning, but in last few years she somehow grow distant with this role and started doing more stuff outside their house and religion. Longing for an adventure, she was much more invested in life with guild and gathering occasional contracts and one day was gone, leaving Netharis family without a single word. 

Her family automatically decided to assume she betrayed family and the goal their family was taking care over decades. Shuvu was the last one to not give up on their sister - They truly believed the sister was a role model, perfect and without a flaw in what she did around the Nabis Shrine, and Shuvu couldn't even imagine there would be anyone else who would do better in leading the family than her. Being the last one believing in her, he decided to find her and bring her back home (obviously thinking that's what she wants)

**Primary Campaign Goal:**    Find their Sister
