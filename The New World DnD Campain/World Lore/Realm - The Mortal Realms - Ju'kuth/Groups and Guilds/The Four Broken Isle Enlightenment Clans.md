### The Journals of the Fox Clan

*Extended mini book of the fracture isle clans*

The four clans of enlightenment seek the idea of the greater mortal power. 

We understand that the other realms that connect to the mortal realm leak power into the mortal realm, but this realm must have existed before them. By the nature of these realms, there is no reason our own world isn't hiding something for us. 

Clan Fox, Bear, Eagle and Dragon each seek the different way. Fox seeks the land of dreams, with a focus on the mind. Bear seeks the spirit, where the soul itself can be tapped into and spent. Eagle seeks the community, where the communal ritual will earn great power. Dragon seeks communion, where instead of seeking the self, they master the 5 realms.

By joining the Kitsune, the realm of the subconscious must become your playground and goal. Meditation is the channelling of the spirit and mind. Where creation and the rules of our realm are only bound by imagination. Lucidity is only the stepping stone. 


*Personal journal*

A major step forward was made by the Bear clan. A full recreation of something they've started calling the astral self. the complete spiritual restoration of a missing limb, the ability to reach further than the arm can stretch and see further than their eyes can focus. Its a major step forward, but we shall not stray from our paths. Another's success is not our own failures. 

Eagle clan has managed to make some progress but with elemental magic. Their proof is complete, the first successful ritual, done by 8 proficient spellcasters to lift their islands into the sky perpetually. a stunning feat worthy of giving their city a new name - Zulimon.

Finally it is our time to succeed. The membrane between the dreaming and waking worlds has been walked by some of our greatest minds - even artifacts created by pure imagination are in our hands. There is so much potential here, we just need something that can focus the mind.

Rumour of the Celestials having found the secrets of mortal enlightenment has been quick to spread. But this is no enlightenment from the reports. This is more akin to the godhood written in legend than an awakening - people have started calling it divinity. However, whatever this is, there is a communal agreement between this clans, this is an affront to mortals - our realm should be wielding by us, not any of the guests who share their power with us. 

Eagle clan is gone, the isle of Zulimon now a smouldering crater holding back the ocean from pure divine fury. What we know is limited, we know the island of the Eidolons has outright disappeared after the night sky was alight with battle mere nights ago - and it seems we are paying its price. This isn't just removal, this us utter obliteration designed to send a message. 

The leaders of the kitsune have made a stand - one half of us consider cowardice. Instead of standing up to our new divine overlords they are escaping into the realm of dreams. One where they can restore everything the other clans have lost - even things they are yet to lose. Without us, they will have to disband or die fighting, but maybe that's for the best for our continued survival ...
