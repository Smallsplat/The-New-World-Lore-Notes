Commander Heathkurl

While your concern over the developments within the Western continents are warranted, I should not need to remind you that they are not of your jurisdiction, and the guild's lawbook on how these events are being followed by everyone involved aside you.

You are being updated on the events as is protocol. Acting upon them, while understandable from the perspective of the weight of the matter, is causing nothing but additional paper-work and resources being sent to issues that would not spawn if we simply ceased conversation. 

Outside that singular perspective, sending hired adventures to assassinate allies of the guild because your limited knowledge of the events that are happening, combined with your quick temper, has resulted in excessive guild resources to be pulled away from continuing our goals. 

Your crew has been intercepted sent back home. I should not need to remind a fellow commander that the hiring and use of adventures on guild missions, even sensitive and highly volatile ones, is incredibly precedented. It's kinda our whole fucking deal. 

So when we are gifted a band of individuals with forgone knowledge gained via questionable means, knowledge which I need not remind you that you do not have, we shall welcome this gift.  If it turns sour, we deal with it. When it doesn't, I shall enjoy updating you about their continued success. 

To conclude and forgo further formality's: 
Your help is hindering us and taking resources away from a delicate situation. Stop trying to intervene without our permission. We're only communicating this because we have to and if we need the help we would rather have it than break protocol and pay the price. 

Respectfully
Commander Amathist of the West Coast Guild.
