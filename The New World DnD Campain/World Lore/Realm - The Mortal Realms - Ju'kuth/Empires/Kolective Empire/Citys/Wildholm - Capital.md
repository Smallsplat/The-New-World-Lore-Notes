#### Overview


#### Architecture
Oversized and multi-cultured. The entire city is scaled for accessibility for large-sized creatures, making a grant, tall and beautiful city of stone and cloth. the brickwork is a soft-cream colour with a soft blue shine, with each building being its own unique style.

Verticality if everywhere, the rooves of buildings are as much roadways as the streets themselves. Bridges connects balconies connect rooftops connect businesses.
