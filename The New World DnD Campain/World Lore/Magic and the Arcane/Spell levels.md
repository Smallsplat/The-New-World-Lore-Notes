### Spell Level Identification
The level of a spell is identified but the amount of arcana required to cast it wholly. The levels scale in order of magnitude, with the weakest being the "Cantrip", required an amount of arcana that can often be syphoned from the air around the caster rather than their personal arcane reserves. 

| Cantrip | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | 11th | 12th |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 128 | 256 | 512 | 1024 | 2048 | 4096 |
Only spells at 10th level exist in current recordings, and is marked by the AMLS [[Caster Levels]] as the mark of an [[Arch-mages]]. 

###  Upcasting and Downcasting
Most spells known by the common folk are classified as "common spells", spells that have been fine tuned by countless spellcasters over the ages to maximise potential within their arcane levels. This optimisation comes in both the casting of the spell as well as upcasting the spell.

In turn, spells that are crafted by spellcasters for specific situations that haven't seen mass adoption are often inefficient, being an entire spell-class or two more expensive than expected. The only spells that seem to be immune to this phenomenon are spells of the 7th level and higher. Due to the arcane requirements scaling so drastically, optimised spells of these calibre are rarely enough to lower their spell class, and instead have new spells of weaker calibres with much weaker effects.

Below is a table of some of the common variant spells
