#### Saturday Squad Return to base

Saturday squad is only 2 hours into the day and in need of a short rest. After seeing the state the crew is in and the fact the arguments are still ongoing, Thalina suggests a trip home as losing one of them right now will push things to a boiling point. They have some downtime (2-3 hours) before the sunday squad gets recalled.
#### Sunday Squad Return to base

Sunday squad is 5 hours into the day and is mostly doing okay. Charlie is informed to recall the squad to discuss the matters at hand by the commander, as the arguments at base haven't calmed and everyone deserves a voice at the table and have covered the primary part of their beaches.

| • Magiscale clearly broke Outpost Skyrise Agreements by leaving the outpost. The tower he appeared in is clearly another outpost                                                                                                                               | • Magiscale has clearly been in the outpost the entire time, with credible witnesses during the incident                                                                           | • Keth's Find person pointing north<br>• Magiscale's clone came with a tower not seen by anyone who has left camp.     |
| • There is no logical way that Magiscale has a clone, dimensional copycat or anything similar. The arcane ability required to achieve that would require Arch-mage status, Something magiscale clearly lacks the ability to possess.                           | • On what grounds does someone as ignorant as Alara know anything about anyone's arcane abilities                                                                                  | • Magiscale was able to banish one of the arcane creatures<br>• Magiscale has been commonly seen using excessive magic |
| • Even if Magiscale WAS capable of it, The only Arch-mage who created such a feat was hunted and executed only a decade or so ago and the research was lost Dispite the amount of "member's of high society" willing to shill excessive fortunes for it return | • Magiscale Has the documents. being a close friend of Maliketh, he refused to let the documents be stolen by some tomebound aristocrat                                            |                                                                                                                        |
| • And on the impossibly that Magiscale was the one who made a clone, it would require excessive negligence to not mention their presence, let alone their presence on the island                                                                               | • Magiscale legimiatly has no idea that the spell worked. The clone "fizzled from existence" when the spell finished. He had every reason to assume the spell failed.              |                                                                                                                        |
| • Magiscale must clearly be removed from the island immediately, the Infocades library sized, and any information about the potential jeopardy Magiscale has put the expedition and the realm in.                                                              | • If the spell did work, nobody knows magiscale more than magiscale does. Magiscale will banish the documents in a way nobody can get them if it means the tomebound don't get it. |                                                                                                                        |
| • Magiscale must clearly, if he's so magical, feel the thick, un-useable arcana in the air that feels so choking, and if hes hiding that from us, what else does he know.                                                                                      | • Magiscale only knows theories, ones anyone else would call unfounded or speculation at best. This meeting needs to deal with truths.                                             |                                                                                                                        |
##### Events during the argument:
• If Magiscale showcases the Maliketh files, it will be behind an arcane wall.
    • Elara will try and dispell the wall to "be able to prove the documents are real"
        • Tyreen will counterspell it, declaring Magiscales right to be protective 
        • Amathist will demand no more spells are cast at anyone from anyone.

• Elara will demand Magiscale casts a 10th level spell as proof he could.
    • The other envoys, the captain and Amathist will initially refuse. Not only would this be an excessive amount of arcana that could reveal their location, but is also potentially deadly and dangerous. 
    • Elara will then demand when the last time Magiscale was marked under an AMSL examination to see if he had even reached spells close to the calibre required.
	    • Magiscale will say it has been over 30 years since he suffered Tomebound education where he was expelled as a 12th level student, mostly due to a refusal to learn evocation and destructive magic.

##### Events after the argument:
• The other Envoys will mention about the people the roamers saw. Magiscale being around doesn't effect that truth.
• The Commanders will request time to discuss future plans, and recommend the squads take leave with the rest of the staff to get something to eat and some rest. 
• Drop and any of the roamers who want to come with him will be pulled aside by Amathist

#### The [[1 - Drop - Kuba|Drop]] / Commander Interview

Amathist will jump straight into questions to gauge Drops reactions. Drop will roll, in private persuasions or deceptions after ever question.

• Who are they
• Why were they on the paladin ship
    • What lead to that?
• Who's the steel defender
	• What powers it.
	• Who did it belong to
	• Why did the paladins have it
• Will people be trying to find them
	•If so, how desperately.
• Why should she trust them
• What's their plan now they're here. 
	 She's sure Magiscale knows a modify memory spell. They could let him forget this ever happened and send them on their way and forget any of this ever happened.
		 The steel defender will take an action outside of a command, Insite would imply it wishes to stay.
		 Amathist hates it, but she has bigger problems to deal with than a walking bag of metal.

New day probably
#### Shuvu's message

When Shuvu does her morning prayers, she will be reached out to by PHYNITIR. She can choose to accept it or refuse it.

"As you reach out prayer, the space around you get enshrouded with a cloak of eternal darkness. The ground you kneel on shifts from (???) to a familiar giant skeletal hand. You feel the warmth of the pheonix before you turn to face your god, Phynitir. Wrapped in dark, billowing robes that shroud most of their form he standing tall and bipedal, their two fiery wings, flickering with ethereal flames are the soul lightsource in this space aside the long, glowing orange beak that pierces beneath a heavy hood.

This is not your first meeting, but its the first without a soul to litigate. The first where you are contacted first, and the first where their hands are empty of the normal tools.

"Shuvu. Guider of lost souls. Servant of Phynitir. I bring news of great import. The lands you walk are blind to me, but I know of their origin. They are the root of a story lost to time. Forgotten by mortal men. A story that should not be revived. Not yet."

"I leave you with guidance. Your sister is here. But, I am blind to her position, but she has not graced my scales. A blessing eternal for mortals it is that way, but a bane for your soul. Seek her. Seek the hidden boons within the isle. Return it to its hiding place. Do not let the ancient ward that blinds me fall. We must all remain blind."
#### Idling in Camp

total PC freedom for most of the day. 
#### Return of the captain

The sound of a ships cannon firing and the Captain of the ship landing at the parties feat, on his feet. After brushing off the gunpowder dust off him and using a healing spell on himself, he'll request to know where the Commanders are, and that they should probably come with.

The captain will talk about how there's been a ton of activity around docks by members of the clergy, partially those of Rani, claiming to be hunting for "The golden Isle", "The isle of creation" and "Fantasia Island". Consistently the people the captain asked said it was generally where this island was, between the three nations, yet nobody has been able to spot it and have started to harass the guild about "the island job". He suspects its only so long until someone works out whatever the person who found this place worked out to find it in the first place.
