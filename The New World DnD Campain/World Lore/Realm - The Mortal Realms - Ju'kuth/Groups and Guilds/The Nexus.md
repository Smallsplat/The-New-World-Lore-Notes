#### The Observer
Species: Aiskari
Gender: N/A

The observer is an enigmatic and alien creature made mostly of dust as black as night but lit with endless distant stars which move as the viewer does. In a tight pink shirt and a clear glass, the observer has accidently stumbled into the house custodian and manages the halls of The Nexus while His Majesty Rests. 

While not formally in command, he is considered as such when it comes to Nexus matters as one of the two members who's core devotion is to the maintenance of the nexus itself. In turn he oversees missions and events that the nexus should be involved in and reaching out to the people with the abilities to resolve it. 
### His Majesty
Species: Dragon
Gender: Male

One of the few dragons outside the elemental realms, His Majesty spends most days resting to absorb the arcane energy from the fey layline to maintain his ageless immortality. its unclear of His Majesty's power or importance to the Nexus, but he is present at the majority of major events and meetings. 

His majesty is the creature that is in charge of the Nexus and its goals, however his affliction makes his actionable energy non-existent or demands the expense of a precious, limited resource of life. 
### The Traveller
Species: Satyr (autumn court)
Gender: Female

A frequent traveller to the realms outside the fey wilds, The Traveller is a fey who knows how to hold her own - but still prefers diplomacy outside of a fight. A lot of mark so to say.
