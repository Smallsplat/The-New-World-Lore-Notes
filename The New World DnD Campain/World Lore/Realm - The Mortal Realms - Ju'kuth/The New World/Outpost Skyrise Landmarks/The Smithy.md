The Smithy is run by a crew of blacksmiths who toil the days refining and building the tools of the trade the guild needs. Be it nails, swords, hooks or armour, you can find someone who can make it here. That said, while money is typically not required for most of the outpost's resources, all the materials need to be outsourced, so trade or reputation is often required to get anything custom. That said, the Smiths love to see the leathers, scales and other tough parts of mighty foes and will happily craft equipment that youâ€™ll never be able to find elsewhere.
