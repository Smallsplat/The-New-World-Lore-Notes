## Potion Brewer - Feat

You can create and maintain potions equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), crafted from a variety of unique materials. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can mix new potions with the materials you have access to or maintain your existing potions. Potions are created with up to 2 materials and gain the effect of each material used. If the same material is used, the dice, duration and range are combined. If any more materials are added, only the last 2 take effect, even if they have no effect. You also learn the effects of the items on the following Material list (Potion Brewer - Knowledge). 

Using a potion takes an action to perform, with the potions' effects taking imitate effect. Potions are used by being consumed, shattered, coated or poured. emptying the potion. Creatures must be conscious to be able to consume potions. Consumed potions can be denied their effects by succeeding a DC 12 + proficiency constitution save, else are twice as effective. Potions that are weakened shatter on impact, coating the target in the effect. Weakening a potion takes 1 minute to perform. When the carrier of a weakened potion takes damage, the glass can shatter and coat the carrier unless they succeed a Dexterity Saving throw with a DC of 10 or 1/2 the damage taken, whichever is higher. Potions can be coated on non-magical objects, tools, weapons and arrows. Coated items apply the effect of the potion until the end of your next turn. Poured potions immediately effect the target or location they are poured on.
