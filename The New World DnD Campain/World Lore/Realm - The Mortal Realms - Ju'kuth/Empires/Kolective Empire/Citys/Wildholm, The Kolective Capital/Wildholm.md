#### Overview  
Wildholm is the cultural centre of the [[Kolective Empire]]. Originally home to the Catfolk, but time,  expansion and becoming an empire have turned what was once a beast tribe into the shining jewel of the Kolective  
  
#### Architecture  
Oversized and multicultural. The entire city is scaled for accessibility for large-sized creatures, making a grand, tall and beautiful city of stone and cloth. The brickwork is a soft-cream colour with a soft blue shine, with each building being a fairly uniform tower of many floors  
  
Vertical infrastructure is everywhere; the roofs of buildings are as much roadways as the streets themselves. Bridges connects balconies connect rooftops connect businesses. Some are wide enough to support carriages and be a part of the greater road network as the grand slope the vity sits on turns upper floors to ground level.   
  
The main thing keeping this from being the shadow-gloomed alleyways of the Tomebound is the sheer width of the roads, wide enough that pedestrians and carriages large enough for a minotaur can park and pass both ways.   
  
In turn, being a country born from war, it's unsurprising to find greenery everywhere there's sunlight. While the city has farms surrounding it in every direction that are protected by external walls, there are planters on every window and gardens on every rooftop not being used as public infrastructure.   
  
#### Culture  
Presentation is everything. Custom clothing, body modding and decoration are status and meaning. Rugs, tapestry's, banners and others cloths decorate the cities greater stonework between green zones. In turn, Stage plays and shows showcasing the new fashion ideas are frequent and popular.  
  
That said, not everyone is hyper extroverted, leading to the city being fairly divided in districts, almost split in half. The city centre is a colourful, flavourful, market-filled fashion show, and the outer districts continue the traditions that kept the Kolective on the map. This divide is not an impassable barrier, yet one can live one's life without ever touching the other.  
  
Labour is respected. Especial those that keep your fellow man safe or betters their lives. The mundane become treasures in these workers' districts. While the rest of the city lavishes in the extreme, the artwork of the master, creating the simple tools to utmost perfection, without the bells and whistles, is a mark of true respect. The guard does not wield the fanciest of blades, seeming like another dullard's worn hand-down, but they are hidden, perfected designs.  
  
While the city is walkable, very few get around without some level of transportation due to the city's sheer scale. Persistent carriage routes to ferry around the common folk at reasonable speed and en masse are everywhere, with a carriage to get almost anywhere arriving somewhere nearby within 10 minutes.... assuming you understand the complex timing and schedules  
  
#### Imports and Exports  
Being the capital its no secret that the city imports more than it exports. Despite that, the city is shockingly self-sufficient when required to be, with farms fuelled by flowing aqueducts. Food and fabrics are the main growths here, enough to keep the city sustained, but any other space is used to fund the cities bustling fashion space.   
  
#### Cuisine  
Hearty, filling, and dense. Soups and food types that could be eaten with some of the most delicious breads are commonplace. Meats are rare but available, typically only used for celebrations, as the city seems to hold a surprising amount of pride on its renewability and sustainability.   
  
Meals are huge, as the city overgrows for its population. Nobody will find themselves hungry and desperate enough that one meal could last you all day if needs be, but even with this, they still hold Festivals of Plenty to offload excess crops that would otherwise go to waste

#### Fashion
Lots of silks - with the capital growing so much and growing ever more efficent farmland was swapped to grow silks and plants used by weavers to create clothing for everyone in the city -
