### The Journals of the Fox Clan

• Goals of the clan is to discover and show others the wy to divinity. While theoretical, it seems possible, and the clans have gotten far through their individual methods. 

*Extended mini book of the fracture isle clans*
• Discussion over the divines actions
• Goals of trying to find divinities with the fellow clans
• Eagle Clan gets wiped off the map by the divine
• Fox clan decide what they have found will have to be enough, however doing so will stop them from interacting with the other clans and leaving them to fend for themselves


The four clans of enlightenment seek the idea of the greater mortal power. 

We understand that the other realms that connect to the mortal realm leak power into the mortal realm, but this realm must have existed before them. By the nature of these realms, there is no reason our own world isn't hiding something for us. 

Clan Fox, Bear, Eagle and Dragon each seek the different way. Fox seeks the land of dreams, with a focus on the mind. Bear seeks the spirit, where the soul itself can be tapped into and spent. Eagle seeks the community, where the communal ritual will earn great power. Dragon seeks communion, where instead of seeking the self, they master the 5 realms.

By joining the Kitsune, the realm of the subconscious must become your playground and goal. Meditation is the channelling of the spirit and mind. Where creation and the rules of our realm are only bound by imagination. Lucidity is only the stepping stone. 


*Personal journal*

A major step forward was made by the Bear clan. A full recreation of something they've started calling the astral self. the complete spiritual restoration of a missing limb, the ability to reach further than the arm can stretch and see further than their eyes can focus. Its a major step forward, but we shall not stray from our paths. Another's success is not our own failures. 

Eagle clan has managed to make some progress but with elemental magic. Their proof is complete, the first successful ritual, done by 8 proficient spellcasters to lift their islands into the sky perpetually. a stunning feat worthy of giving their city a new name - Zulimon.

Finally it is our time to succeed. The membrane between the dreaming and waking worlds has been walked by some of our greatest minds - even artifacts created by pure imagination are in our hands. There is so much potential here, we just need something that can focus the mind.

Rumour of the Celestials having found the secrets of mortal enlightenment has been quick to spread. But this is no enlightenment from the reports. This is more akin to the godhood written in legend than an awakening - people have started calling it divinity. However, whatever this is, there is a communal agreement between this clans, this is an affront to mortals - our realm should be wielding by us, not any of the guests who share their power with us. 

Eagle clan is gone, the isle of Zulimon now a smouldering crater holding back the ocean from pure divine fury. What we know is limited, we know the island of the Eidolons has outright disappeared after the night sky was alight with battle mere nights ago - and it seems we are paying its price. This isn't just removal, this us utter obliteration designed to send a message. 

The leaders of the kitsune have made a stand - one half of us consider cowardice. Instead of standing up to our new divine overlords they are escaping into the realm of dreams. One where they can restore everything the other clans have lost - even things they are yet to lose. Without us, they will have to disband or die fighting, but maybe that's for the best for our continued survival ...


### Euphrosyne's Parents letter

Our Dear Euphrosyne,

Your hope for a dramatic reveal of this letter seems as hopeful as your claims of a lord of a realm you refuse to enter. 

The strength your mortal realm explorations are noted, all be it with the understanding of its fragility and temporary nature as is the curse of all of mortals petty creations. Ones as important to the ongoing of the summer courts can't merely wander into the mortal realms to seek audience with our selfish, self-centred daughter - especially when we have to deal with the fallout of your little show. And trust us when I say this - it is a show. One that many are eagerly watching. 

As your eternal guardians, let me give you advice you clearly need - return now at the peak of your influence, with lavish mortal gifts, and we can still spin this into a story that can play into our hands. 

If not, I shall no longer insult you with mere mercenaries. The goals of the summer court are bigger than this.

Your father, cold rain on a warm eve, harbinger of twenty treaties, bringer of the summer sun, wielder of the fey furies Lord Munin of the Summer Courts


--- hidden letter

Dearest Euphrosyne, first to the fray, our gift of the midsummer court! - ♥

Your father is uptight and singularly aligned - he does not see how your ventures into the mortal realm is a greater good for all of us, yourself included... but only if you return home some day safe.

I don't pretend to understand. I won't pretend to not be disappointed, but I won't lie by saying that your course is not one I support as long as your own safety is secured. You can still bring great pride to the house of the summers - word is our lord of stories is with you now - something your father can't say has happened to him yet.

As an aside, your messenger is a swift and proficient at their work. Not enough to avoid my notice, obviously, but I have left them a gift to get to your hands when appropriate. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try and ensure your safety. 

Lady Ember, truth of the western wilds, judge of seven courts, and creator of the mortal fighter! - Your mother.

p.s I am still furious at you at you encase my honeyed words made that tone too sweet.

#### Events:

Post fight events - 

Returning to the city a towncryer will announce the breaking news that the Tomebound have denied the construction of a new city and officials are investigating the rumours of the obalisk forges reactivation.

On the trip back Shus eidolon will reahc out to them to offer answers, but will note their stay can only be shorts as even this conversation breaches the leyline open 
Will leave Shu with a gift - a glimmering cosmic seed that grants him a new ability.






The dockworker (Jill, Female Human) will point them towards the Incomers Hub to get access to the cantrip "touch rep" which us is used as the secondary currency of this empire. Rep, or Reputation is to be given out to every product or service the individual buys by using the cantrip on the products signature for 1 action. Each individual can provide a Bonus rep for 2 actions once per day, which all companies fight tooth and nail for. 

Somone will note about how some Halvaxus paladins, the real scary ones with the darksteel plate headed the direction their going not more than a few days ago, refused all travels or communication aside immediate details. They obliged, of course, nobody wants to get on the wrong side of the chaos god but was as unsettling as ever.

The City

If the crew get to the city (with enough survival checks to locate it) they will find the halvaxus paladins dead. No visible damage is on their armour aside the brunt force of falling from the upper floors. Their gear has the fundamental runes expected of a higher-ranking paladin,

Izumi's dream will take them deep into the Ebonstar mountains, into a valley between mountain ridges, surrounded by endless savannahs. Following down the valley will take them to an abandoned city built into the mile-high walls. Broken bridges and ledges hanging overhead showing a bustling city that no longer is. 

The city will be filled with ancient common broken runes - wards that would hide their location, burned out inscriptions that were used store spell energy, and the center of the city held by chains is the remains of a ritual site.

as Izumi explores, he will bump into objects that are not there. Insight will learn that hes colliding with objects and things that are there in the real world, things that have been hidden from this dream

A figure wearing a solid wood mask can be found after discovering the ritual sight, who will hold their hand up, causing the earth under their feet to spin rapidly in the direction to Izumi's current location, snapping him out of the dream as they connect 

---

After, The Hatter will take their leave, apologising about how short their time together was, and while hes excited to write more from first hand accounts, there are other chapters of this story happening elsewhere that he simply must go see themselves. He refuses to give any information, but the implication is that her saytr, Leanan, seems to be making moves of their own. 

The traveller will show up to catch their ride, and will promise to meet again soon, if nothing else but to show up when things aren't going to hell.

Magical item: Globe of Figmented Skies

A small-globe shaped object with a mimicry of the night sky directly above. A small gear on the side when twisted projects the display out of the globe and into the space around it as 3 dimensional figments in a 25ft space around the globe. This can continue to scale up as twisted further, however projections 25m away from the globe disappear. 

Due to the nature of the scale of this cosmos, in the mortal planes the initial projection causes a rush of visible stars to eject from the orb immediately, requiring a DC 15 reflex saving throw or be dazzled 1 to anyone looking directly at the globe.

Eaone will get an invitation to meet with Big Dog privately. The conversation will imeddiatly establish that this is not about work of the world but about meeting someone else like him - an isolight species, that wasn't made alongside him.

He will talk about his history, His enlightener, Tellarum, and his three other brothers who were his lifelong friends. How the Archmage enlightened only the ones he could trust to protect him. He was the only survivor after the Bloodstar Assassins hunted him down. 40 assassins attacked the place, only 5 made it out alive after taking Teallrum and his brothers lives. 

He knows them by name. 
Eaksati Afriani
Terrli Holly
Grangi Guts
End the brothers Askri and Entri Perco

They split the bounty of 5 million gold between them. Tellarum had no enemies, he lived alone in a tower deep in the Ebonstar mountains as we all know the superstition of what happens to archmages. 

He knows everything about the, but is bound by code to protect his new crew. He learns what he can, and does what he can, but the Blackstar don't step foot in the Kolective much anymore for him to hunt his vengance.

He'll mention how it seems every Isolight he meets always has a villain in their story, and will prompt Eaone to share their story. He will tell the names of the Paladins that killed his owner and kin. If Eaone mentions their Lich, he will write their name on a sheer and pin it to the wall with a list of other names, including the assassins of Tellarum, and say that he persoanlly will keep Eaone updated if he hears anything, and requests Eaone does in kind. 

The conversation can continue from there as natural, there is no rush to send eaone home.

**Famous Kitsune Biomancer Kacsy** 
Grand antlers protrude from her head, the fox's ears are larger, with her orange/back/white colourisation changed to represent more of an African wild dog with a little more symmetry and styling. She is followed by a massive minotaur women, large for even a large creature who works as her bodyguard. 

Will find the crew with the tip from her patrons about an incredible biomanced creature who's been spotted around the city recently, but upon actually meeting Eaone, they will need a moment and then confirmation to learn that Eaone is an Isolight, and not another creature under heavy biomodding. 

She will apologise and invite Eaone and her crew to visit her salon if they have the time as a massive favour, she would still love to learn Eaones features but understands if the topic and idea of crass.

• Kaelam fortude saves for Arcane Sickness - finally having no threats or events looming over him has him attune to the fact his elemental body has been effectively suffocated from elemental energy and he hasn't had enough time to attune to the mix of everything, but particularly the overwhelming fae arcane that suffuses the air.

The Euphrosyne Incident:

5 Fey hunters, Araveks, water-based execute a plan to track Euphrosyne back to the fey wilds. The effect will be a chain of 5 effects:
• Euphrosyne will feel inclined to look behind her - doing so will see the entire road completely empty (Suggestion)
• Euphrosyne will look back to her friends, who are now also missing - she is alone in the street
• At the end of the street she'll see the silhouette of a familiar satyr. (Phantasmal image)
• A portal is summoned in the street behind Euphrosyne, hidden to her to appear as empty street
• Euphrosyne will feel complete dread at approaching the satyr, and is compelled to run away down the street - into the portal she can't see

If the party can't stop her via magical means, The traveller will appear, grab Euphrosyne by the arm and ask her if she trusts her. Being in a magic-riddled state and confused she won't be able to identify that its the Nexus satyr until she accepts the hell, at which point she'll be cleansed of all magical effects. She'll yell to the party to run, don't get used as a hostage, before taking off herself

#### Nexus
