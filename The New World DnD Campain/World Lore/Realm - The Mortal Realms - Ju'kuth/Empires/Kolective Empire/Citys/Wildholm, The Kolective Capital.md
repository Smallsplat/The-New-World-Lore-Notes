#### Overview
Wildholm is the cultural centre of the [[Kolective Empire]]. Originally home to the Catfolk.

#### Architecture
Oversized and multi-cultured. The entire city is scaled for accessibility for large-sized creatures, making a grant, tall and beautiful city of stone and cloth. the brickwork is a soft-cream colour with a soft blue shine, with each building being its own unique style.

Vertical infrastructure is everywhere, the rooves of buildings are as much roadways as the streets themselves. Bridges connects balconies connect rooftops connect businesses. Some are wide enough to support carriages and be a part of the greater road network. 

The main thing keeping this from being the shadow-gloomed alleyways of the Tomebound is the sheer width of the roads, wide enough that pedestrians and carriages large enough for a centaur can park and pass both ways. 

In turn, being a country born from war, it's unsurprising to find greenery everywhere there's sunlight. While the city has farms surrounding it in every direction that are protected by external walls, there are planters on every window and gardens on every rooftop not being used as public infrastructure. 

#### Culture
Presentation is everything. Custom clothing, body modding and decoration is status and meaning. Rugs, tapestry's, banners and others cloths decorate the cities greater stonework between green zones. In turn, Stage plays and shows showcasing the new fashion ideas are frequent and popular.

That said, not everyone is hyper extroverted, leading to the city being fairly divided in districts, almost split in half .One side a colourful, flavourful, market-filled fashion show, and the other continuing the traditions that kept the Kolective on the map. This divide is not an impassable barrier, yet one can live their life without ever touching he other.

Labour is respected. Especial those that keep your fellow man safe or betters their lives. The mundane become treasures in the workers district. While the rest of the city lavishes in the extreme, the artwork of the master creating the simple tools to utmost perfection, without the needs of bells and whistles is a mark of true respect. The guard do not wield the fanciest of blades, seeming like another dullards worn hand-down, but are hidden, perfected designs.

While the city is walkable, very few get around without some level of transportation due to the city's sheer scale. persistent carriage routes to ferry around the common folk at reasonable speed and on-mass are everywhere, with a carriage to get almost anywhere arriving somewhere nearby within 10 minutes.... assuming you understand the complex timing and schedules

#### Imports and Exports
Being the capital its no secret that the city imports more than it exports. Despite that, the city is shockingly self-sufficient when required to be, with farms fuelled by flowing aqueducts. Food and fabrics are the main growths here, enough to keep the city sustained, but any other space is used to find the cities bustling fashion space. 

#### Cuisine
Hearty, filling, and dense. Soups and food types that could be eaten with some of the most delicious breads are commonplace. Meats are rare but available, typically only used for celebrations, as the city seems to hold a surprising amount of pride on its renewability and sustainability. 

Meals are huge, as the city over-grows for its population. Nobody will find themselves hungry

#### Fashion
