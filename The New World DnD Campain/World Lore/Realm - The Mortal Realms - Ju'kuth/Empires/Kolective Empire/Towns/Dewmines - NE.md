**Beast Tribe: - Ratfolk**
#### Overview  
Home of the Ratfolk, the Dewmines is one of the few towns in the Kolective that struggles to make accommodations for the many kinds of creatures. Most of the city is underground, as the small mouse folk live their lives away from the elements  
  
#### Architecture  
The entire city is tunnels dug into the side of a chalk cliff, with only the surface around the cliff hosting a small outpost for visitors from abroad. In turn, the inner town is a nesting maze of paths and routes where every direction takes you somewhere useful. With access to so many rare minerals and metals, the architecture of the Ratfolk is shiny and strong
