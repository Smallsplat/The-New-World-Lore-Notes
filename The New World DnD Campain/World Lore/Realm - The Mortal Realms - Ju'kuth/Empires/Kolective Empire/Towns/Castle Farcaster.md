#### Overview
Isolated on the North east isolated island, Castle Farcaster is well maintained remnant of the old war. While previously a bastion that overlooks the sea and waterways into the Kolective, its now a fully functioning small village that lives inside its walls, maintaining the traditions of protection that the honoured Warband upkeeps. 

#### Architecture
The castle is a relic and marvel of its time. The outer walls are thick but contain and protect the city within them, literally. with a small air gap protecting them from the outside elements, the walls are thick enough to contain houses and stores. In turn these houses are thin but long, decorated more like a modern mobile home .

The castle itself is a well-maintained century old relic that shows both the efficiency and flare of the Kolective army. complete with a grand hall, armour and full round table. The portcullises has full access, each with lookout towers overseeing as much of the ocean and waterways as can be, minus the mountain blockage. 

The main courtyard reflects the industrial war machine it was designed around. Instead of a large social garden there's a huge forge, big enough to to be manned by a full organisation. 

Around the castle are Nullberry generators, aura generators that mitigate or removes magical effects entirely.
#### Culture
Manned by the "Wolf Guard", they are one of the Kolective's three honour warbands. While they upkeep the honoured traditions that surround Castle Farcaster. These duties include:

• Ocean counting - Counting what flags are being flown on the ships in and out of the bay

• Island Patrol routes - The island is open to the public but patrol routes to ensure the islands security are still maintained. There are dedicated routes that are maintained with time checks to meet and phrases to share, however these are often more lax

• Castle and Equipment maintenance - The crew craft, upgrade, maintain and support their own equipment. 

While the island is technically open to visitors, the travel area and maintenance as a military function limits civilian access to the island to the castles and the main paths. 
#### Imports and Exports

The castle is funded entirely via imported goods. The practice spawns from both the importance of the island's defensive platform. if the island was over-run, needing to be sustained externally would be a borderline impossible task for an outside force to upkeep without exposing significant supply line weakness due to the distance.

In turn, a lot of the imports are mostly short-life foods and resources to maintain the traditions and upkeep of the castle, as well as any effects the crew requests within budget. In turn, the crews effectiveness often leaves excess material.

#### Fashion
The Wolf Guard have a signature royal blue outfit with yellow highlight's between  that tints their armour regardless of amour type. 
The heavy plate have blue padding and undershirt visible with yellow trims around the plating. The shoulder guards have the wolf symbol engraved and embossed. 

The leather light armour is fully dyed blue with yellow undershirt and off-items, like the gloves, boots and similar. They wear the wolf guard symbol on a cape which is worn either on their back or  as a wrapped tucked waist-guard

Lightweight armour is blue robes with yellow cuffs around the arms and lower trim, along with yellow-dyed pants. The lightweight armour has the wolf guard icon on the chest pocket, being the most subtle of the signatures.

Dog themselves has a garb more similar to a centaurs overcoat, acting more as a covering that protects the body over traditional wear due to their unusual form. on both sides are obvious holsters, each containing a great sword that is connected via a quick-release chain that Dog manipulates with a base level of telekinesis
