The lodges of the outpost are numerous and unremarkable, designed to be built on mass and fairly cheap. Each Roamer squadron gets a lodge, each with bunk beds, storage, a fire and a table. Due to the general communal nature of the outpost, it is common to see the lodges as the only truly private place while in town, and entering other lodges without permission is considered highly odd and requires reasonable explanation.
