### Spell Caster Levels
Spell casters follow the Arcane Matrix Levelling System (AMLS), which tracks the standard arcane abilities of those who can wield arcana. The AMLS is based in the average progression of a primary spell caster. Creatures that weave both the physical and the arcane are only scored based of their arcane ability.

The AMLS test is often a formality within educational spaces, where the spellcaster is asked to cast the spell of the highest level they can, as many times as they can without the use of magical artefacts or inherent arcane gifts, such as the sorcerers "sorcerers point".
