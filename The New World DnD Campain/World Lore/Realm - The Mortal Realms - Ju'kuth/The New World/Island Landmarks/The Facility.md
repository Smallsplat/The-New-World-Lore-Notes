The Facility is a Mix of Magitech and cave systems within the northern Mountains on the isle of Phantasia.  It serves as the main point of interest on the isle, containing a bounty of the islands secrets and treasures.

Points of interest include:
• The Ward - The ancient mechanism defending the island from the god's gaze 
• Cryochambers - Warriors of the ancient battle suspended in time, ready to hold the line again if the moment came
• Data Centre - The knowledge bank of the facility, disconnected from damage and ware to the facility over thousands of years
• Cephalon Phayters Chambers - The conscious that helps run the faciality, who has been in hibernation for the last 12953 years.
• Living quarters - Equipment and facilities for solders to maintain morale and sustain them
• Automaton Manufactory - The derelict and abandoned manufactory farms for the automation defence force that have long disappeared


Phayter will need to be awakened from her Habitation Protocall, where she will initially be chirpy about the rest and back to be active, before realising she doesn't recognize the party. After trading questions, vaguely recognising Steely and Hill, she will run diagnostics and realise she has been offline for 12953 years. She will offer to help the players however she is of limited use with all her systems and connections offline.

Bootup sequence will reference the above rooms all of which will have large error list a and failures with connection issues.
