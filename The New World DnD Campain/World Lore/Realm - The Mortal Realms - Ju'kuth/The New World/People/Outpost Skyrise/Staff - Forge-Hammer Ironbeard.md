#### **Description:**
A bulky tank of a Tiefling that runs the forge. Joined the guild after he stole fire from the hells and showcased his prowess with the hammer with his custom armour, designed to fit the horns of a Tiefling and survived being dumped into lava directly. Ironbeard is the best smith money can’t buy. Decided to join the expedition because it was the most exciting thing they’ve offered in a while and what's the point of being the best smith in the realms if your tools were just used against petty thieves or exploring empty crypts?

#### **Important Details and notes**
Has a wielding mask with a big iron beard, Can’t actually grow a beard
