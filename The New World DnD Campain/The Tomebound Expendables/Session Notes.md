### Session 0
It's been at least 2 months deep within the bowls of the Incarnium prison walls. The Tomebound Expendable programme is alive and active again, sending criminals back out into the wilderness and backdoors of the Tomebound to deal with the messy business that they don't want to be associated with.

The collection of vague artefacts, the activations of runes, fighting robots, the meeting of distant organisations. If the Tomebound wanted it without their names attached. The random misfits they could barely trust were out and about doing what needed to be done. 

The arrival of an inmate with armed personal mercenaries, soon to be outed as Elara Mystweaver, seemed to take a sharp turn in the missions, leading towards a significant amount of snooping around the adventurer guild and Tomebound infrastructure. A chain of events which came crumbling down after a significant stealth missions goes horribly wrong, forcing a changing of the guard and bringing the expendable expeditions to a halt. 

For about a month anyhow, with tasking returning back to normality. As normal as the Tomebound using it's prison system to its pollical ends. Bridge destruction, the defence of elemental infrastructure, and just as quickly into snooping around the guild, but this time for corruption and deception.

This came up to a climax upon a raid on Elara's Mystweavers personal library, collecting documentation and whatever other trinkets that seemed important to either them or the Tomebound, an event that triggered the plan of an elaborate escape by Mystweaver into the elemental plane at the sacrifice of his bodyguards, followed by the assault of adventurer guild houses across the Tomebound, an assault overwhelming enough to demand the use of the expendables to hold the line.

And its in this chaos, our 5 expendables hatch a plan for their own escape
### Session 1
The Tomebound had run out of fresh expendables to send to the frontlines of the guild houses and started cycling back in anyone who would have the strength to hold the line in any way. Our five expendables; Euphrosyne the Centaur Fighter, Eaone The Awakened Witch, Izumi the Magus Kitsune, Kaelam the Human Kineticist and Shu the Leshy Summoner, organise an escape plan.

The portal runes that transports the expendables has exposed runes that dictate its function, and by manipulating the runes, could send themselves anywhere in the world. Expecting retaliation, the squad setup to buy Eaone as much time to work. It was only 1 round before the guards caught on, filling the room with a paralyzing gas, but it was all they needed, opening a portal deep into the Kolective wilds and escaping through while Gourdy, Shu's summonable plant companion, stayed behind to destroy the evidence behind them.

Escaping through, the party finds themselves either knee or head high in saltwater, surrounded in a torrential storm limited only by the smothering canopy. A miserable place... but free. Knowing the scrying spells that observe their actions were still active, and without any assurance the portal would remain closed for long, Kaelem offers the party steppingstones above the waterline to escape deep into the featureless mangroves.

After struggling to find solid ground, they settle down a while away from a raised bamboo-like scaffolded spotted on the horizon to remove any landmarks while being watched. Setting up camp on a foundation of rock, using a crude construction and a mangrove tree to shield themselves from the weather. After collecting some fruits, a shockingly successful fishing competition and a little magic, the group get to have their first proper meal in months.

Swapping the changing of the watch through the night along with a Gourdy to keep them company, the crew take their first uncomfortable, hard, cramped, wet, but unshackled rest.

### Session 2
After their short rest, the team heads out to the bamboo-like path they spotted the previous day, following the storm into the heart of a small silent town. After a small search, they find their way to the home of the Tripkee elder where the village morning feast is being hosted. Being welcomed in and offered a small meal, the tribe disperses and the elder welcomes the new guest, however, being a happy isolated village had no work for the group. 

Heading out, after hearing about the nearest city being a couple hours north, they are briefly stopped by the Tripkee front guards to check for contraband before heading down the path in the storm. The trip was mostly peaceful, minus an attempted ambush by the mangroves crocodiles.

Arriving in the city of Dondri the group finds their way to the guild house, looking for work and a dry space to actually read through the notes from their raid on Elara's library. The documentation shows the entire "discovered island" escapades. About how it was grounding a hidden layline to Luminae, the realm of the eidolons. How the mortal's gods are divine yet mortal beings who could be defeated like any other being and all of Elara's plans to use the layline to become the new gods of this realm.

Realising the severity of the documents, yet without sources to trust, the gang crashed in the guild temporary shelter to rest, ready to venture to earn some gold in the morning

### Session 3
Awoken by a surprise visit by guild member officials with a band of backup surrounding their temporary quarters, the team are met with an confused Commander Amathist demanding to know why the Tomebound are trying to use this guild house to enact their laws. She informs the crew that the Tomebound have declared them allies of Elara Mistweaver, however given the groups brazen lax of security around their highly classified documents combined with still carrying around the stolen bags of holding with trackers within them... She has her doubts.

The team explain their situation, how they were just opportunistic escapees using the chaos to escape the expendables programme and prison. Amathist seemed unfazed, willing to supply the crew with a small collection of conveniences: a reasonable sum of money, an easy disposal of the tracking devices and anti-scrying plates, and in exchange, giving the guild the documentation about the island and battleplans of Elara.

This exchange was mildly interrupted by the Dragonborn Charlie's investigations discovering Gourdy's strange arcane signature, being covered by a strong enchantment to disguise it as Fae magic, at which friend revealed themselves; revealing that both Gourdy and Friend were, to some degree, tied to Eidolon magic, confirming Charlie's theory that the layline being open would have left proof of its existence.

Saying their goodbyes after their trade, the team gets out of Dondri after tossing the trackers on a specified boat and heading out on their bounty to find the missing traders. A quick visit to the Dewmines, the home of the Ratfolk teaches them that the trader, Spirit, a Tengu traditional trader of magical items had not arrived in a few days, and the minotaur trader of rare materials should be on the way today was also late. 

After trading some frozen fish for some Ratfolk mushroom cuisine, the team heads south to spend the night and inquire at the traders previous stop, the Lizard Lounge of Lagomouth

### Session 4
Arriving in the Lizardkin village of Lagomouth, our adventurous find themselves finally able to take time to themselves, not hounded this moment by guilds or country. In this village-surrounded hot spring, the crew sign customary fake names on the entry forms and take to resting for the next day.

A venture around a trinket bazaar have them pick up a Purifying Teaspoon to ensure meals on the go, followed by a few hours lounging in the hot springs sharing stories and memories until the sun was well below the horizon. After paying for a meal of a surreal amount of sushi varieties and lodging in the taverns adventure's suite, the crew drop for a few more drinks, some magical, some for a taste of home, and relax in actual beds for their first actual nights rest.

### Session 5
Taking their leave from Lagomouth, the crew head out to continue their trader trail. Making their way to the great bridge connecting the two islands they inquire with the local ferry crews to learn that, yet again, the traders hadn't made their way over the bridge. Traversing over and enjoying the sights, they meet the same ferry crews and they never even reached the bridge. 

Taking their leave and heading towards the fey wild layline major port-town, they stumble upon one of the Cultural trader caravans surrounded by a collection of city guards. Verifying their bounty with the guild, they allow the group to investigate. They find tracks going deep into the nearby forests, a small countries fortune of rare metals and leathers, and a druidic symbol the traders interact with to mark their passing, which spirit had not passed.

Tracking the hoofprints deep into the woods, they find evidence of a fight leading to a small encampment of a collection of clerics and champions, with the two traders tied up in the middle along with the other trader caravan. Getting as close as they can without getting spotted and without asking questions, the crew knock out as many paladins as they can and free the traders, healing the minotaur enough to join the fight.

Level up to level 4!

### Session 6
Looking for answers, the group rounded up the survivors of the battle before talking to the traders, finding that these were Rani Champions and paladins. An inventory check finds that all of spirits wares are accounted for, if not muddled and disorganised. Confused, the team awoke one of the paladins who was uncooperative, trying to cast an identify magic spell multiple times on Gourdy but was interrupted by the first of centaur fury. 

The few bits of information they did learn was vague at best. The paladins seemed to be on the hunt for a "blasphemous" object. One that they could not describe, but were using a bulky arcane identifier to discover it. Unconvinced and unable to get many other answers, the crew knocked the paladin back unconscious before the guards summoned to assist arrive.

After answering their questions, the squad regroup with the traders and collect two Trader Tokens, and are offered a range of powerful magical items to take as gifts before partying ways. The crew head to the feyline city of Thirthrit to hand in the bounty, earning 150g and a request to catch up with Amathist crew. 

The meeting was brief, with Scotch, the grey herengon (rabbit) dropping by to check in about the Rani paladins operations. Sharing what they knew, scorch remarks about how despite the situation, it was generally better news than they had hoped and leave the crew with well wishes before they are freed to go find somewhere to eat and rest.
