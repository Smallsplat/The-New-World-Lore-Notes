### Euphrosyne's Parents letter

Our Dear Euphrosyne,

Your hope for a dramatic reveal of this letter seems as hopeful as your claims of a lord of a realm you refuse to enter. 

The strength your mortal realm explorations are noted, all be it with the understanding of its fragility and temporary nature as is the curse of all of mortals petty creations. Ones as important to the ongoing of the summer courts can't merely wander into the mortal realms to seek audience with our selfish, self-centred daughter - especially when we have to deal with the fallout of your little show. And trust us when I say this - it is a show. One that many are eagerly watching. 

As your eternal guardians, let me give you advice you clearly need - return now at the peak of your influence, with lavish mortal gifts, and we can still spin this into a story that can play into our hands. 

If not, I shall no longer insult you with mere mercenaries. The goals of the summer court are bigger than this.

Your father, cold rain on a warm eve, harbinger of twenty treaties, bringer of the summer sun, wielder of the fey furies Lord Munin of the Summer Courts


--- hidden letter

Dearest Euphrosyne, first to the fray, our gift of the midsummer court! - ♥

Your father is uptight and singularly aligned - he does not see how your ventures into the mortal realm is a greater good for all of us, yourself included... but only if you return home some day safe.

I don't pretend to understand. I won't pretend to not be disappointed, but I won't lie by saying that your course is not one I support as long as your own safety is secured. You can still bring great pride to the house of the summers - word is our lord of stories is with you now - something your father can't say has happened to him yet.

As an aside, your messenger is a swift and proficient at their work. Not enough to avoid my notice, obviously, but I have left them a gift to get to your hands when appropriate. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try and ensure your safety. 

Lady Ember, truth of the western wilds, judge of seven courts, and creator of the mortal fighter! - Your mother.

p.s I am still furious at you at you encase my honeyed words made that tone too sweet.
