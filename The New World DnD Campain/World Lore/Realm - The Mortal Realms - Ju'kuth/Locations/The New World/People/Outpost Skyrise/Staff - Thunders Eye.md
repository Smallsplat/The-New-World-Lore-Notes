Thunder is a 7ft tall, flat chested, armless Female Tabaxi (Serval), wearing traditional monk robes, long drapes that that stop at the shoulders and are tied around a thick red waistband, baggy leggings and fur-tight socks that cover only the heal of her paws. Two spectral hands follow her as if they were connected to non-existent arms, however are clearly free to move past the expected limitations, able to reach up to 30ft away from her before causing visible strain. Her waist-band is coated in pockets that stretch down past the base of her tail, filled with alchemical ingredients for potion making. 

Born without arms, she grew up forced to learn to use her long legs to manipulate the world around her, helping her mother in the home-run alchemy store to the best of her abilities until the store was visited by a Monk of the astral form.

Discovering this ability that she could summon her lost arms from within, her mother let her go with the monk and learn able to summon spectral forms of themselves in combat and dedicated her life to mastering the art. An art she would spend her entire youth and adolescence wholly to when she wasn't making a living with her alchemical healing. 

This full dedication to the astral teachings was announced complete as she manifested her hands for 16 hours straight, her arms not only returned, but with more capabilities than even mortals, able to reach 30ft away from her with ease, with the exception of heavy objects. 

She now wonders the world with intermittent visits to home, helping those in need and teaching the way of the astral form
