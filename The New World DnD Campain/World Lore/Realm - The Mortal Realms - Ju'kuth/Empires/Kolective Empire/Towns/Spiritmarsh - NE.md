**Port Link: - [[Dondri - NE]]**
**Beast Tribe: - Tripkee**

#### Architecture
Home of the Tripkee, sentient humanoid frog people whose home resides deep in the deep in the **Chalow Mangrove**. Their round clay huts stand upon supports alongside and within the mangrove roots, connected on raised scaffolded roads on intricate Redii scaffolding and supports. The rainy swamps aren't the most visited by outsiders due to their generally uncomfortably wet nature to most of the beast tribes, but the Tripkee are a welcoming sort to any who venture out to their neck of the swamps.

#### Imports and Exports
Redii is the main import and export here outside their food products, a bamboo-like structure with significantly better construction properties, being more bendable, less brittle and easier to maintain a farm, however is a sickly off-green colour that is often painted or dyed over.

#### Cuisine
Small, thin pathways into the forts seem to lead to nowhere, but if you know where to look can find fishing traps, and the treetops house balconies of farmlands to get to the sunlight, which cycle the soil from the swamp bed itself. Even these mangroves bear sweet, dry fruits that feed into their main cuisine called Quazigenium

#### Fashion
Due to their general persistent wetness, living in the wet damp swamps as creatures that thrive in water, their clothing often focuses on its flexibility in and around water. Being water tight, not absorbing water, yet buoyant enough to help with water traversal with plenty of quick remove strips and ties to keep the fit to the form. --- This leads to a single-sheet robe designed to capture air when worn that cuts off at the shoulders, with straps that pin the chest and waist. elbow-long fingerless gloves that allow the Tripkees unique hand structure to swim and climb with ease, with straps that pin the wrist and elbow to keep them water-tight. All of which is effected with a thin water-proof enchantment rune hidden on the inside of the fabric, ensuring the quality and comfort despite the weather.
