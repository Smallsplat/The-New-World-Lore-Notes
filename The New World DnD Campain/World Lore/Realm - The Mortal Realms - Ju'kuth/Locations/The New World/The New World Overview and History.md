## Ancient History
The New World, also know as Fantasia is the the forgotten home of the [[Eidolons]] and their [[Laylines|layline]]. This small island was the only part of the planet Ji'kuth the eidolons claimed as their own and was used as a testing ground for their ideas and concepts.

During the [[2. Celestial War Of Mortality|Celestial War Of Mortality]], the Eidolons were the primary target of the celestials and was the battleground of the [[2. Celestial War Of Mortality|Battle of Fantasia]], where mortal followers of the celestials empowered by their strongest powerful the celestials could muster tried to claim control of the island and the eidolons. This surprise attack left the eidolons on a losing defensive, and only with the help of some Fae, Mortal and Primordial allies were they able to execute an escape plan. 

The Island of Fantasia was teleported to the Moon of [[Planet - Shadothra|Shadothra]] called Gemi, dispersing the terrain grounding the eidolon layline, making traversal between the realms impossible. The other realms, with the time the Eidolons had brought, were able to prepare more fortified defences that resulted in the now Mortal Celestial Gods only being able to capture [[Realm - Avernus|Avernus]].

On Gemi, the island's care was put to the Eidolons servants and care takers, the [[Kolimate]] who spend their time on cosmic confinement continuing the work of the Eidolons and awaiting the day the Celestials were overthrown from their claims at godhood so the eidolons could return.
