One of the oldest nations whose history has, ironically, been lost to time, the Tomebound are harbingers of information first and foremost. This haven of magic has lived a life of mostly casual luxury, with the most renowned spellcasters and artificers having trained here. Due to the sedentary nature, the Tomebound are a sparse and fairly undiverse culture of humanoids, mostly comprised of elves, humans and dwarfs.

Everything within the Tomebound's workforce has been automated or had the workload reduced as much as possible, with automatons, Warforged and most technical inventions being crafted within its territory. Portals to the Great Library of Halvaxus are frequent as it’s the central point for great minds to connect and in turn the architecture within The Tomebound’s territory is either rich cities or individual operating centres with little physical infrastructure connecting them, as any wayward venture capitalist with a scroll can connect the realm with just a word.

The Tomebound want the island as it’s theorised to be the location of the final, unknown, layline, a magical phenomenon that connects the realms' sources of magic. Being untapped for so long, the potential for an experienced magic wielder to create feats never seen before is unparalleled and to waste it on a mere trading post or the idea it’s “deserved” feels inadequate at best to them.
