#### Elara Activities Report
A.G Kol Main - ES - Elara Activities Report #14

Elara's ability to enlarge his following has remained consistently successful, however the rapid growth and pains that come with it are seemingly out of their chain of commands control - or lack there of. It seems Elara has tried to execute on plans without gaining a board of trusted leaders, and given the downright insensitive and rude messages we've intercepted between individuals over a recent failure, we should expect this to change in the very near future. 

From my understanding, a structure or item of high value has been, at best, misplaced by members of the cult that was pivotal to what they claim to be the the easiest of their plans. What this object is has been mostly left to pronouns, making it hard to identify, however it seems that the item was meant to be traceable and yet it is entirely lost. 

In turn, missives seem to have put further immediate plans on hold as Elara is looking to organise his follower base into a chain of command. I expect this window to be a short, as it is typical that cults as of this will require proof of loyalty, at which the scale of severity we will need to keep track of.

However, this implies that Elara has given us a significant window before he makes his next major move. We shall continue to monitor to discover the identities of these new people of interest and keep the guild informed
