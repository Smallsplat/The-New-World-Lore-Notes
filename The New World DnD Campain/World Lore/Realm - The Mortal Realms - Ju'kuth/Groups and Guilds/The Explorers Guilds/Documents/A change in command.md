Officers of the Guild,

The continuation of Operation Eidolon has caused the need for a change of command. While this operation is confidential information to the highest degree, the acts of Commander Highturner has seen his removal from the project, and has been replaced with Commander Amathist. 

In short, the emotional integrity of Hightuner has seen multiple attempts to persuade those involved in the operation to execute a band of adventures. This group is unique as they are the party that recently escaped a Tomebound high security Jail with knowledge of Operation Eidolon that we thought otherwise unknown. While we had suspicious they may be enemies of the guild or nation, their recent actions have been both proactive to the support of the Kolective, Guild, and the communities around them - even for adventures, there have been 0 reported crimes. 

Regardless of this useful resource and fundamentally beneficial party, Hightuners short-sightedness has requested, repeatedly, the assassination of this party, particularly due to the Tomebound propaganda that this group are agents of Elara Mystweaver. As of yet, there has been 0 proof to propagate this. There should be no need to explain why this goes against everything the guild stands for.

This has become a common, repeating flaw of Hightuner, which given the obvious importance of this operation, can not stand to maintain being the chief commander of this fragile situation. However, all parties agree that his knowledge of the situation demands he continues working on the operation with a lesser role.

Commander Amathist of the West Coast Guild.
