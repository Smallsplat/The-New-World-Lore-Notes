A Male Tiefling with a quick wit and a desire to learn. This sneaky envoy seems to know everything that goes on in the outpost but never out of malice. Information is a resource to him and all envoys of the Ebonstar, and it is to be collected and bartered for.

He dresses in a smart outfit that is clearly still leather armour with rich colourful drapes on fitted trousers with twin scimitars. His curved back horns between short black hair are lightly decorated with chains and jewels and yet his movement is entirely silent.

He hides behind this game for information to know that the Syndicate chose him for a reason, and failure is more terrifying than success, as what worth to the Syndicate is the man who lost the empire an entire island.
