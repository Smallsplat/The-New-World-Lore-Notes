#### The Museum
around 825 gold in raw value - which the city was willing to help fund if all the coins are legitimate. The party is invited to look around the museum, which contains an array of artifacts:

A green dragon scale - Owned by the Dragon Yagorash, gifted to Yarilanish, the Kolective Arcane guild who saved his life 4000 years ago by opening a portal to the elemental realm using fey magic - a feat that today scholars still don't understand how it was performed.

An array of spears from eras - The Kolective has been a machine of war for as long as it has survived, and its best represented by the weapons of war used. AN obvious note is that modern spears have become more ornamental as peace has reined for an extended level of time, so quantity is being out-competed with quality, and spears are being used less to piece manufactured armoured but natural ones. 

An array of art pieces - the oldest of which show the beast races being more pure to their original bestial shapes and often only contain one species - where arcane modifications and on-mass co-mingling arn't the norm yet

The Figurehead of a boat combined with an array of driftwood - A monument to significant fallen ships that held the lines in notable battles - 

An ancient amulet of Hydrathir - The god of the sea has been the root of worship in the isles for obvious reason and benefit, and this amulet showcases how time-honoured the traditions are.
