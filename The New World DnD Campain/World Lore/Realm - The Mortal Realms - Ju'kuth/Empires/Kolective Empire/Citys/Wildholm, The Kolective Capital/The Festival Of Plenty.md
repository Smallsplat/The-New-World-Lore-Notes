## Events 

#### The Shadowlife
A shadowfell Tik-Kit, a snake-like beast defined by a "spine" covered in thick, plated bone-like structure, which has the rest of the body shaped by strips hanging from the joints made from a material similar to plastic that lightly grazes the ground where they walk. A closer perception can see the "Skull" of the creature, similar to a birds skull, is entirely cosmetic and the equivalent of a hat to give mortals something to focus on when talking, which can move up and down the spine as needed.

The game is fundamentally a chain of "Trust Or hide" trip through the shadowfell. The game is a mix of the TikTIk having fun looking at the reactions of mortals at the norms of the Shadowfell, but also educational about things to avoid in the realm of void. A magical darkness shows figments to represent the game as if they were in a PoV

> • Obsidian Obelisks, Big red symbols representing an eye follow the pov. Trust is the correct option, as the eyes can give away your position to greater threats, but provide no threat themselves
>•  An Aiskari appears. These creatures the team already know to trust
>• A creature covered of countless tubes and releases harmonic yet desynchronised sounds of a grand organ shaped as a floating donut that slowly rotates. Trust.
>• A humanoid that can only been seen through twisting the background . Hide is correct. as these are the remains of mortals that have been destroyed by a Talikak - touching one will swap your body with theirs, damning you to their fate as they are freed
>• The obelisks return, but one with a burning blue eye. Hide is the correct call - the colour is easy for mortals to see the difference, but these are no obelisks, and are knowledge-hungry beasts that will devour your mind.
>• A Tik-tik arrives. They are to be trusted to win the game. 
> • A perception check is needed to notice that a voided being is blocking out stars, else its just an empty void over blackened sand. Hide is correct, as the creature us nameless but the most feared predator in the shadow fell.

#### Mystic Morgon The All-Seeing Gorgon
A female gorgon earing a blindfold over hers and all of her snakes eyes. "my eyes see the waves of time, the paths most travelled, the flow most powerful. My words are fate, but fate can be fought. Take these words not at gospel of the future, but a path walked if uncontested"

• Euphrosyne :
 A chaotic future where the balance between individual ideology will be challenged by the groups she cares about the most - not for their wants to limit her personal ideals, but a true belief of the greater good. A balance must be struck, but that balance branches too sporadically for my words to find meaning. 

• Eaone:
Another with many paths and a weak river, leading to a weave with to many routes... but an giant knot has been tied in your future. The past that haunts you will hunt you eventually, the length of threads to the weaved knot wane and stretch, but only few bypass this knot of fate... but the future past it should not be feared.

• Izumi:
The flow of fate is strong with this one. Greater forces are guiding the river to their goals, a vessel at which goals are achieved and enacted. But these forces are weak - their guidance is strong but deniable. Malleable. Able to be shortcut and cheated and taken control of. Great things can come of the path, but only with your guidance. 

• Shu
The river of fate is almost non existent with this one. One so free of desire, creed or duty. Some consider it a blessing, however fates as fickle as these can turn from historic greats to the lowest of lows in meer moments. A colour of the weave arrives consistently though - one of the call home of the wilds, and one the call of a place that has no vision. A place I have never seen and can not divine. I'm afraid the weaves of time are to thin to divine anything more. 

• Kaelam:
A draconic creature enters my tent and asks his future to be divined when his kin have frozen their weave. And yet, your weave moves. Slowly, unwinding, time slowly reclaims you, but the weave moves too slowly for my eyes to see your future.

This game has a few warbands in uniform watching the event in small groups, probable recruiters or vested interests. Bar squad from The Wolfguard on [[Castle Farcaster]] is here who can inform the squad that the Wolf Guard have been moved off the isle temporarily while a full sweep of the island is executed by other bands. If the team do well, they will offering hiring the crew as an potential auxiliary unit - getting paid to support the team on future operations, similar to guild work but with the support of up to 9 other professionals. 

They'll note that most raid level bounties the guild gets in the Kolective just end up being Warband work, so if multi-stage plans with other professionals interest them it'll probably be worth it.

Scout will be sat 2 floors above on the edge, feet dangling off, watching the brawling. She'll comment on how shes been watching to see if there's anyone of note, potential hirelings and such. She'll update the crew that there's rumours of movement with Elaras command structure but some innocuous guild bounties is the area sound help disrupt it for a bit longer.
