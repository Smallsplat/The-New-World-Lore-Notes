### Pouch of Crafted Gestures,
A rough bag made of canvass, leather or other work material. It can hold up to 3 bulk. This bag magically assists in the creation of heart-warming trinkets that help make an impression. 

Make a crafting check with a DC equal to a Task Level your choice, you can spend an hour to create a 1 bulk trinket with the items within the bag. This check can be made on the move and can be split into different parts. Regardless of the DC check, all items in the bag are used. 

Critical Success: Your attempt is successful. The trinket provides an Item bonus equal to quarter the Task level (minimum of 1), +1 non-stackable circumstance bonus to make an impression or similar diplomacy check when gifted to a creature. 
Success: Same as a Critical but without the +1 bonus. 
Failure: You fail to create a trinket, and all items and resources in the bag are lost. 
Critical Failure: Same as failure, but the bag is unable to create trinkets until a long rest.

When a trinket is gifted to a creature, the trinket loses its magical effect. These trinkets hold the same value as the resources used to craft them + One day in the Income earned table, up to double the base resource cost. For example, a Expert crafter who succeeds in crafting a Task level 5 trinket using 50sp worth of materials will make a +1 trinket worth 1gp.

### Bracers of Cunning Apparition: 
Usage: worn; Bulk -
A pair of silver bracers. A red glass-like gem adorns each bracer. The contents of the gem swirl hypnotically with the slightest movement, as if encasing a void of endless stars.
##### Thousand-Faced Apparition
Activate: Change Shape; 
Duration: 1 minute / sustained; 
Effect: You take a Step, Stride or Sneak action, an illusory duplicate of your previous form appears where you were standing for 1 minute. Only one duplicate can be active at any time. The duplicate is highly detailed and has no obvious visual tell of it being an illusion; creatures with no way to see through illusions must touch it, strike it, or use seek to attempt to disbelieve it, unless it does an action that would otherwise be obviously physically impossible without additional effects.

Whenever you move as part of this effect or Sustain it, you may instruct the illusion to: 
• Create a Diversion, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check 
• Feint, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check 
• Stride, Crawl, Drop Prone, Leap, Stand, Hide, Sneak, Swim, Take Cover, or other movement-based actions
• Feign Interaction, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check to believe the action was successful, such as pressing a button or activating a pressure plate, until there is enough evidence to prove otherwise.
A creature does not automatically disbelieve the illusion on a failed deception attempt. 

If you Change Shape into a form of the same size and the same ancestry trait (humanoid to humanoid for example), you can roll a Deception check against the Perception DC of all creatures observing you to shed your duplicate without anyone noticing. 
On a success, you become Hidden to them.  On a failure, or upon changing to a form of a different size, there is a 50% chance (a 1 or 2 on a d4) that the observer will target the duplicate, unless they have seen through the illusion via other means or have reasonable intent otherwise.
##### Fox's Accomplice
You can spend 1 minute to create an illusory duplicate of your current form without using Change Shape or of a willing creature you can touch. Duplicates created this way have the same effect as one created by Thousand-Faced Apparition, but can be instructed to do feign a chain of up to 8 tasks of any actions or downtime activities, last 8 hours instead of 1 minute and do not dissipate when others are made.
