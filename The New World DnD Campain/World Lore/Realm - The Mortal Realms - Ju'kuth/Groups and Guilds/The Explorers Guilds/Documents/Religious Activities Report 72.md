A.G Kol Main - ES - Religious Activities Report #72

Current activity implies Rani is still hunting for relics that will let them re-access the banished isle. They seem to have made little progress in discovering what relics to even look for, however their raids of guild property attuned to the Eidolons have seemingly set them on a path to finding other artifacts like it. While if they found a relevant artifact of this nature they would be successful in their mission, our continued searches, combined by the lack of island to find, means our benevolent deities are running blind. A fact I find joyfully ironic. 

That said, Phynitir seems to still be working against their fellow kin in these endeavours, and their followers are still receptive to communication around the subject, even when direct divine intervention detects our lies. The information we learned much about the Undead Phoenix on the isle seems to be continued in his actions even to this day. While I am hesitant to consider them a complete ally given their nature and the uncertainty of our future end-goal, their continued allegiance and assistance makes it hard to assign them as anything else.

In conclusion, I can happily report that the religious front remains horrendously behind the other parties trying to be a part of the Eidolon situation.
