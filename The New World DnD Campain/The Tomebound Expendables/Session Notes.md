### Session 0
It's been at least 2 months deep within the bowls of the Incarnium prison walls. The Tomebound Expendable programme is alive and active again, sending criminals back out into the wilderness and backdoors of the Tomebound to deal with the messy business that they don't want to be associated with.

The collection of vague artefacts, the activations of runes, fighting robots, the meeting of distant organisations. If the Tomebound wanted it without their names attached. The random misfits they could barely trust were out and about doing what needed to be done. 

The arrival of an inmate with armed personal mercenaries, soon to be outed as Elara Mystweaver, seemed to take a sharp turn in the missions, leading towards a significant amount of snooping around the adventurer guild and Tomebound infrastructure. A chain of events which came crumbling down after a significant stealth missions goes horribly wrong, forcing a changing of the guard and bringing the expendable expeditions to a halt. 

For about a month anyhow, with tasking returning back to normality. As normal as the Tomebound using it's prison system to its pollical ends. Bridge destruction, the defence of elemental infrastructure, and just as quickly into snooping around the guild, but this time for corruption and deception.

This came up to a climax upon a raid on Elara's Mystweavers personal library, collecting documentation and whatever other trinkets that seemed important to either them or the Tomebound, an event that triggered the plan of an elaborate escape by Mystweaver into the elemental plane at the sacrifice of his bodyguards, followed by the assault of adventurer guild houses across the Tomebound, an assault overwhelming enough to demand the use of the expendables to hold the line.

And its in this chaos, our 5 expendables hatch a plan for their own escape
### Session 1
The Tomebound had run out of fresh expendables to send to the frontlines of the guild houses and started cycling back in anyone who would have the strength to hold the line in any way. Our five expendables; Euphrosyne the Centaur Fighter, Eaone The Awakened Witch, Izumi the Magus Kitsune, Kaelam the Human Kineticist and Shu the Leshy Summoner, organise an escape plan.

The portal runes that transports the expendables has exposed runes that dictate its function, and by manipulating the runes, could send themselves anywhere in the world. Expecting retaliation, the squad setup to buy Eaone as much time to work. It was only 1 round before the guards caught on, filling the room with a paralyzing gas, but it was all they needed, opening a portal deep into the Kolective wilds and escaping through while Gourdy, Shu's summonable plant companion, stayed behind to destroy the evidence behind them.

Escaping through, the party finds themselves either knee or head high in saltwater, surrounded in a torrential storm limited only by the smothering canopy. A miserable place... but free. Knowing the scrying spells that observe their actions were still active, and without any assurance the portal would remain closed for long, Kaelem offers the party steppingstones above the waterline to escape deep into the featureless mangroves.

After struggling to find solid ground, they settle down a while away from a raised bamboo-like scaffolded spotted on the horizon to remove any landmarks while being watched. Setting up camp on a foundation of rock, using a crude construction and a mangrove tree to shield themselves from the weather. After collecting some fruits, a shockingly successful fishing competition and a little magic, the group get to have their first proper meal in months.

Swapping the changing of the watch through the night along with a Gourdy to keep them company, the crew take their first uncomfortable, hard, cramped, wet, but unshackled rest.

### Session 2
After their short rest, the team heads out to the bamboo-like path they spotted the previous day, following the storm into the heart of a small silent town. After a small search, they find their way to the home of the Tripkee elder where the village morning feast is being hosted. Being welcomed in and offered a small meal, the tribe disperses and the elder welcomes the new guest, however, being a happy isolated village had no work for the group. 

Heading out, after hearing about the nearest city being a couple hours north, they are briefly stopped by the Tripkee front guards to check for contraband before heading down the path in the storm. The trip was mostly peaceful, minus an attempted ambush by the mangroves crocodiles.

Arriving in the city of Dondri the group finds their way to the guild house, looking for work and a dry space to actually read through the notes from their raid on Elara's library. The documentation shows the entire "discovered island" escapades. About how it was grounding a hidden layline to Luminae, the realm of the eidolons. How the mortal's gods are divine yet mortal beings who could be defeated like any other being and all of Elara's plans to use the layline to become the new gods of this realm.

Realising the severity of the documents, yet without sources to trust, the gang crashed in the guild temporary shelter to rest, ready to venture to earn some gold in the morning

### Session 3
Awoken by a surprise visit by guild member officials with a band of backup surrounding their temporary quarters, the team are met with an confused Commander Amathist demanding to know why the Tomebound are trying to use this guild house to enact their laws. She informs the crew that the Tomebound have declared them allies of Elara Mistweaver, however given the groups brazen lax of security around their highly classified documents combined with still carrying around the stolen bags of holding with trackers within them... She has her doubts.

The team explain their situation, how they were just opportunistic escapees using the chaos to escape the expendables programme and prison. Amathist seemed unfazed, willing to supply the crew with a small collection of conveniences: a reasonable sum of money, an easy disposal of the tracking devices and anti-scrying plates, and in exchange, giving the guild the documentation about the island and battleplans of Elara.

This exchange was mildly interrupted by the Dragonborn Charlie's investigations discovering Gourdy's strange arcane signature, being covered by a strong enchantment to disguise it as Fae magic, at which friend revealed themselves; revealing that both Gourdy and Friend were, to some degree, tied to Eidolon magic, confirming Charlie's theory that the layline being open would have left proof of its existence.

Saying their goodbyes after their trade, the team gets out of Dondri after tossing the trackers on a specified boat and heading out on their bounty to find the missing traders. A quick visit to the Dewmines, the home of the Ratfolk teaches them that the trader, Spirit, a Tengu traditional trader of magical items had not arrived in a few days, and the minotaur trader of rare materials should be on the way today was also late. 

After trading some frozen fish for some Ratfolk mushroom cuisine, the team heads south to spend the night and inquire at the traders previous stop, the Lizard Lounge of Lagomouth

### Session 4
Arriving in the Lizardkin village of Lagomouth, our adventurous find themselves finally able to take time to themselves, not hounded this moment by guilds or country. In this village-surrounded hot spring, the crew sign customary fake names on the entry forms and take to resting for the next day.

A venture around a trinket bazaar have them pick up a Purifying Teaspoon to ensure meals on the go, followed by a few hours lounging in the hot springs sharing stories and memories until the sun was well below the horizon. After paying for a meal of a surreal amount of sushi varieties and lodging in the taverns adventure's suite, the crew drop for a few more drinks, some magical, some for a taste of home, and relax in actual beds for their first actual nights rest.

### Session 5
Taking their leave from Lagomouth, the crew head out to continue their trader trail. Making their way to the great bridge connecting the two islands they inquire with the local ferry crews to learn that, yet again, the traders hadn't made their way over the bridge. Traversing over and enjoying the sights, they meet the same ferry crews and they never even reached the bridge. 

Taking their leave and heading towards the fey wild layline major port-town, they stumble upon one of the Cultural trader caravans surrounded by a collection of city guards. Verifying their bounty with the guild, they allow the group to investigate. They find tracks going deep into the nearby forests, a small countries fortune of rare metals and leathers, and a druidic symbol the traders interact with to mark their passing, which spirit had not passed.

Tracking the hoofprints deep into the woods, they find evidence of a fight leading to a small encampment of a collection of clerics and champions, with the two traders tied up in the middle along with the other trader caravan. Getting as close as they can without getting spotted and without asking questions, the crew knock out as many paladins as they can and free the traders, healing the minotaur enough to join the fight.

Level up to level 4!

### Session 6
Looking for answers, the group rounded up the survivors of the battle before talking to the traders, finding that these were Rani Champions and paladins. An inventory check finds that all of spirits wares are accounted for, if not muddled and disorganised. Confused, the team awoke one of the paladins who was uncooperative, trying to cast an identify magic spell multiple times on Gourdy but was interrupted by the first of centaur fury. 

The few bits of information they did learn was vague at best. The paladins seemed to be on the hunt for a "blasphemous" object. One that they could not describe, but were using a bulky arcane identifier to discover it. Unconvinced and unable to get many other answers, the crew knocked the paladin back unconscious before the guards summoned to assist arrive.

After answering their questions, the squad regroup with the traders and collect two Trader Tokens, and are offered a range of powerful magical items to take as gifts before partying ways. The crew head to the feyline city of Thirthrit to hand in the bounty, earning 150g and a request to catch up with Amathist crew. 

The meeting was brief, with Scotch, the grey herengon (rabbit) dropping by to check in about the Rani paladins operations. Sharing what they knew, scorch remarks about how despite the situation, it was generally better news than they had hoped and leave the crew with well wishes before they are freed to go find somewhere to eat and rest.

### Session 7
The crew take some downtime! Euphrosyne and Eaone work on creating Plate Mail for two days at a local forge. Izumi and Kaelam try and learn anything about curses via the many adventure markets here, but only find magical items. And Shu finds work as a healer to earn a chunk of money.

Equipped with new gear, the crew search for a new bounty to continue earning their keep. Picking up A bounty of a missing artefact, they head out to meet up with the research guild who issued it. A trip that took a brief pause to deal with a Melixi swarm with shocking efficiency and without civilian casualty.

They meet up with the researcher Tilli, a Nagaji who told the group about their missing artefact, an arcane focus attuned to an "unknown" type of arcana, that had been stolen from the guilds internal safe boxes. The main vault lock had been magically opened with some sort of divine magic, where the safebox itself had been forcefully smashed. 

An inquiry about local recent events also discover that the researchers had had a recent investor that acted incredibly odd, offering a significant amount of money with very brief talks and yet to be seen again.... but with only that to go with, the crew take their leave to try and chase up any leads they could find. 

### Session 8
Having found lots of suspicious and little direction, the crew were about to head out to the adventurer's guild to update Amathist and her crew of the overlapping interested when Friend decided to go on a solo mission. Chasing them down, friend disappears into a window of a local observatory being help up by guards who claim they're actors of the state, who seem quick to jump to murder â€¦ however a minor scuffle later and some awful persuading, their back-up turns on them.

Free to explore, the group explain the wonders of the mortal world to a confused Euphrosyne and find an array of suspicious activities. A collection of story books of the Luminae series opened to random pages, the arcane focus transformed into an arcane lens, a weird magical rock shard, and a message confirming Elara's theories written by and unknown party... and put a note offering a meeting with the unknown party.

Confused and concerned, the party return to their goal of heading to the guild house and get in contact with Charlie, transferring what they've learned to the understandably distressed dragonborn. They make plans to return the focus anyway to remove suspicion and head back out into the city...

### Session 9
The crew return the focus to a deeply confused and impressed researcher who was full of questions about not only where it was found but how they were able to find it so quickly. Fascinated by Eaones familiar, they request to stay in contact encase they could use someone who is so attuned to this "unfamiliar" source.

Taking their leave with a signed bounty, they take their 3rd trip across the city and find the Feycity's warbands setting up a self-ran festival, showing off the new inventions and tech they had brought or invented to attract further investors or customers. The crew opt to not join the festivities and earn a little extra cash after being invited to brawl with a Tomebound-brought automaton.

Handing in their bounty for a 150 gold, the crew check the festivities and local stores for any extra high quality gear, collecting a musket staff and staff of healing before resting for the night. 

A new day, a new bounty. The team go looking for the latest missions when a tTngu burst through the door desperate to hire adventures. A local science lab has been over-run with escaped experiments of their lead researcher studying the curse of lycanthropy and vampirism, and the crew jump on the opportunity to help, catching a Rotli that chases through the city to deliver them at the laboratories doorstep. 

### Session 10
The crew are fighting through the laboratory of plant gremlins. Not much to add in the way of story due to the nature of combat-heavy sessions

### Session 11
Storming into the final room in the laboratory, the crew use the professors unique changes to the curse to obliterate the plants with some scrap shards of mithril. Saving the small Rat who introduced himself as Professor Bigglewizz, they discuss the professors... unique perspective on the world. 

He eagerly tells the party about curses, being magical effects that are self-sufficient, how the Syndicate's pirates are commonly lycanthropes and such, when Izumi asks about his sisters affliction.  While unable to provide any immediate help, the fact his sister was unable to be cursed via the most common methods implies something is cursing her externally, leading the party to keep an eye of for Spider lily plants, being the only locational tie to her sisters curse. 

Using the mithril to clear out the remaining plants, the crew claim their bounty and pick up a mystery about a key with an unknown use, and take the rest of the day off to recuperate. Izumi goes to lookout for clues to chase down, while Euphrosyne and Eaone work on inscribing runes into the centaurs great sword. 

The next day they head out of the city, narrowly avoiding a short dwarven man Euphrosyne seemed to recognise and met Hera, the Dragonborn lady who had the unusual key, adored with dragon symbolism without any obvious lock to open. 

Level up to Level 5!

### Session 12

Given free range of the house to explore, the team split up to hunt down clues about where this key could be used. The crew finds:

â€¢ The key was held in the hands of a deer-headed fey creature, kneeling holding a coin that sat a signature stylised pillow. Under the pillow the coin had inscribed "In Trickery there is Trust" 
â€¢ The lower area of the manors smell faintly of moss and rock as if they were in a cave 
â€¢ The office and reading room had a weird amount of books about diplomacy and history, particularly around important draconic and fey figures 
â€¢ There was a bunch of common Elemental plains trinkets, the kind of stuff you would want if you were living there but would otherwise be mundane
â€¢ The plants in the gardens tell the crew there's some large cavern somewhere under the manor
â€¢ In the attic was a large portrait of a grand, very dragon-esk dragonborn with elk-like horns, the title "The Baron" under it in Common, and under it in Draconic "Wishes is Wealth". 
â€¢ A lot of the windows in the manor have the garden foliage pointed in a way that allows a view of the Well in the garden, to the point it feels a little weird how shaped the garden is, and at the bottom of the well was a small collection of coins that had gathered up overtime 

Putting some of the clues together, they toss a coin down the garden well, opening a hidden stone pathway into where the basement of the manor. Finding a plain stone room with a door at the end with a matching statue of a draconic creature in the same pose, holding a similar coin which had inscribed "In fire there is Warmth". Putting the Key on the pillow, the door opens, revealing and activating a portal to somewhere unknown...

### Session 13

Stepping through the portal, they find themselves in a opulent room full of deactivated portals to unknown places in the world. An unknown voice demanded to understand their intent before revealing and introducing themselves as The Observer. A Shadowfell Aiskari who calls people by titles, who seems to have the ability to passively observe the memories of those around them. 

They gives them a "tour" of the location, calling it "The Nexus". Showing the party and Hera a sleeping dragon infused with both elemental and Fey magic named "His majesty", and shares that this is a place of diplomacy between the different realms. He quietly tries to separate the crew, which Izumi somehow resists. 

Each member of the part gets a simultaneous yet private conversation with the Observer. Kaelam the Planeswalker, Izumi the Realmbender, Euphrosyne The gift of the midsummer courts, Eaone the Awakened soul and Shu the Wandering spirit.

These conversations mostly involve the observer collecting the parties insights and clear their mind of their many thoughts, as their initial observations saw an adventuring party of many origins, which would be of value to the goals of The Nexus. 

They shares a few bits of key detail for the entire party, notably that he, and seemingly all of the important figures of the shadowfell are privy to the secrets the guild is holding, and yet they are keeping their aligned goals a secret. They also updates the party that the Tomebound are using them as a way to try and mitigate Elara's influence, making them well known criminals within the nation which massively hinders their ability to be of immediate help to the nexus.

 As a parting note, they grant each of the members of the party a custom gift as well as grant and party a magic key that would allow them to return to the Nexus at any time. They request they return when their name has been cleared within the Tomebound. Taking their leave out the front door, the crew head to the nearest sign of civilisation, briefly meeting a follower of Phynitir who offers to join the party temporarily, which he then turns down after the party's insightful questions get a bit too much. 

### Session 14

Heading up to the castle, the crew are intercepted by a small band of Catfolk in matching outfits who query about when the crew made it to the island. After a lot of internalised and silent flack after Euphrosyne's instinctual lie about swimming here, Shu convinces the patrol is a half-truth, that a teleportation effect warped them to the isle.

After checking their bags for any obvious contraband or obvious criminal activlity, they inform the group that there's no more boats out of the island today, but they could find lodging in Castle Farcaster, the outpost their warband occupies.

The crew take their leave to the castle, finding the gate open and meeting a ratfolk who welcomes them and lets them know where they can find a place to rest, and while he doubts there work for them, they can contact "Big Dog" in the castle to see if there's anything they can do. 

After yet more internalised and silent discussion about how to introduce themselves, they finally meet Big Dog, a centaur-sized German Shepard in a armoured kilt, who lets the crew know that while he doesn't have work, the castle has a ton of spare supplies they can help themselves on if they wish to help themselves to make use out of it. 

With nothing better to do, the crew collect themselves a bunch of mundane but useful trinkets and tools for essentially free as the castle collects the rest of the warband collects for the night. Before they head to bed, they are invited to check out the view from the castle walls... where an eagle-eyed Shu spotted an invisible character roaming in the fields around the castle.

Given the suspicion, the warband send them out with a patrol to try and catch the individual, however given the extreme disadvantage the party was in to catch an invisible spellcaster, they got away with the crew none the wiser about who or why for now.

### Session 15

After a brief sweep of the area the crew re-group with the patrol sent out with them to amplify the nearby island magic nullifier generator, sharing their lack of actionable trails or success. They rendezvous back in the castle and where Euphrosyne shared a full briefing with the entire warband. Without much to work with but wanting to act immediately, the Captain Big Dog gave the crew the task of moving around the nullification generators.

The crew head out in the middle of the night and upon heading to the first generator, Shu spotted a strange alloyed crystal. A mangled, inefficient arcane focus and locator that was sending arcane power vaguely deeper deeper in the island. Trying their best to follow that trail, they discovered a deeply hidden and covered grove, at which in the centre was a compass, drawing out an exact copy of the island from the ground up, including its inhabitants, massively underpowered and running incredibly slowly.

### Session 16

In the middle of the night, no oversight, and an artefact made by a legendary crafter... the crew does what any good thieves do, and dismantled it as much as they could with their low light and crafting skills. Pocketing it in their pouches, they get back to completing their task of moving around the nullifier generators without further events aside finding a few more rocks, now seemingly inert.

Reporting in to find Big Dog has taken rest for the night, the view does the same, waking at about new day to see the castle in its active state, full of tourists and visitors. They hand off the new map to Big Dog, who seems frustrated at their immediate "destruction" of seemingly vital evidence, yet lets them know the cargo ship ahs been docked awaiting them to let them off the island at their earliest convenience 

Heading out, they board the ship and take sail to Drondi, when the ship gets intercepted by a Tomebound scout craft who seems to know that there are Tomebound fugitives onboard....
