• The mines are a maze of puzzles where the party has to not kill any of the skeletons dispute them trying to defend their phylactery. There seems to be no signs of battle key locations include:

 • **An ancient library** bound by enchanted books, many bounded by curses and blessings. The blessings can only be activated once before returning to a dulled state. They can be recharged with a spell slot immediately, or after 24 full hours  
 
> A **blessed** book can contain:
> 	• Ancient favourable trade deals between the Dragons and Fae. Opening the book Grants Lucky 1 (add a +1 to your next Flat Luck check)

> 	• A book of blessings and gifts granted to those in need. Opening grants a 1d4 to checks to help another for the day. 
> 	• A translation guide of common words to say in the others tongue. it out-dated and almost unusable. Opening allows you to understand another language, but only at a primitive level (Concepts and Themes but not full understanding)

> A **Cursed** book can contain:
> 	• A list of dragons who refuse to participate if the fey cultures and festivities.  Opening grants a -1d4 to checks on selfish acts for the day. 
> 	• A list of fey tricks to beware of. Opening the book Opening the book Grants Unlucky 1 (subtract a -1 to your next Flat Luck check)

> 	• Twos books of common fauna and flora in both the Feywild and Dragonrealms, most of which are unremarkable to todays cuisine. 

 • **A Deep well** Somehow similar to the one in the manor house. Throwing a coin down opens a secret tunnel into a room with a dragons head, mouth open, with a incredibly dusty and worn pillow expecting a key. 
 > The room is lit by Everlight crystal powered lanterns

• **A Huge Dragon statue** makes up the walls of the room with incredible detailing. Upon greater inspection, this seems to be a replica of the Ancient Fallen Dragon Asctiatarti. However, whatever ancient magics that enchanted this statue had dulled overtime. 
> Grants the "Asctiatarti Blessing" if tented for, prayed at, or other notable favourable actions a detectable effect, but has no obvious properties

• An **abandoned market place,** filled with ancient, crumbling wares that had rotten or rusted from ancient ages of time - aside the coin, where 
>5d10 coins from a bygone era can be collected. They are functionally worthless outside the metal they are made of - unless a collector could be found to appraise their value

• A **communal meeting hall** containing little of value or import
> A working Flask of Fellowship is among a collection of many other identical mundane mugs 
> A flute seems to be enchanted, making it a Maestro's Instrument. The instruments here seem to be the only things that have survived the ages of time, but they seem worn even still - they seem to be important to these people

• A **drowned smithy** - damaged so much that it would be cheaper to craft a new one from scratch - none of the tools here as salvageable or saveable 
> A "Flaming Star" (Aincent dragon scale) has been worked to be able to be affixed to an object to grant it a small boon that has survived the ages

• A **basic Training room** - Tidied way and unused for eons. rotted folding chairs and tables line the walls, seeming to make this room both a study hall for intellect as well as brawn
> Has a pair of Backfile Mantles - seeming safety gear for these brawls between high magic users
> A pair Bracers of Missile Deflection - More safety equipment

**Other loot**:
> A corpse compass, seemingly used by a skeleton to ensure that the denizens are still alive.
