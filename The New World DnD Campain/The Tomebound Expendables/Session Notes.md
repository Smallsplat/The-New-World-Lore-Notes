### Session 0
It's been at least 2 months deep within the bowls of the Incarnium prison walls. The Tomebound Expendable programme is alive and active again, sending criminals back out into the wilderness and backdoors of the Tomebound to deal with the messy business that they don't want to be associated with.

The collection of vague artefacts, the activations of runes, fighting robots, the meeting of distant organisations. If the Tomebound wanted it without their names attached. The random misfits they could barely trust were out and about doing what needed to be done. 

The arrival of an inmate with armed personal mercenaries, soon to be outed as Elara Mystweaver, seemed to take a sharp turn in the missions, leading towards a significant amount of snooping around the adventurer guild and Tomebound infrastructure. A chain of events which came crumbling down after a significant stealth missions goes horribly wrong, forcing a changing of the guard and bringing the expendable expeditions to a halt. 

For about a month anyhow, with tasking returning back to normality. As normal as the Tomebound using it's prison system to its pollical ends. Bridge destruction, the defence of elemental infrastructure, and just as quickly into snooping around the guild, but this time for corruption and deception.

This came up to a climax upon a raid on Elara's Mystweavers personal library, collecting documentation and whatever other trinkets that seemed important to either them or the Tomebound, an event that triggered the plan of an elaborate escape by Mystweaver into the elemental plane at the sacrifice of his bodyguards, followed by the assault of adventurer guild houses across the Tomebound, an assault overwhelming enough to demand the use of the expendables to hold the line.

And its in this chaos, our 5 expendables hatch a plan for their own escape
### Session 1
The Tomebound had run out of fresh expendables to send to the frontlines of the guild houses and started cycling back in anyone who would have the strength to hold the line in any way. Our five expendables; Euphrosyne the Centaur Fighter, Eaone The Awakened Witch, Izumi the Magus Kitsune, Kaelam the Human Kineticist and Shu the Leshy Summoner, organise an escape plan.

The portal runes that transports the expendables has exposed runes that dictate its function, and by manipulating the runes, could send themselves anywhere in the world. Expecting retaliation, the squad setup to buy Eaone as much time to work. It was only 1 round before the guards caught on, filling the room with a paralyzing gas, but it was all they needed, opening a portal deep into the Kolective wilds and escaping through while Gourdy, Shu's summonable plant companion, stayed behind to destroy the evidence behind them.

Escaping through, the party finds themselves either knee or head high in saltwater, surrounded in a torrential storm limited only by the smothering canopy. A miserable place... but free. Knowing the scrying spells that observe their actions were still active, and without any assurance the portal would remain closed for long, Kaelem offers the party steppingstones above the waterline to escape deep into the featureless mangroves.

After struggling to find solid ground, they settle down a while away from a raised bamboo-like scaffolded spotted on the horizon to remove any landmarks while being watched. Setting up camp on a foundation of rock, using a crude construction and a mangrove tree to shield themselves from the weather. After collecting some fruits, a shockingly successful fishing competition and a little magic, the group get to have their first proper meal in months.

Swapping the changing of the watch through the night along with a Gourdy to keep them company, the crew take their first uncomfortable, hard, cramped, wet, but unshackled rest.

### Session 2
After their short rest, the team heads out to the bamboo-like path they spotted the previous day, following the storm into the heart of a small silent town. After a small search, they find their way to the home of the Tripkee elder where the village morning feast is being hosted. Being welcomed in and offered a small meal, the tribe disperses and the elder welcomes the new guest, however, being a happy isolated village had no work for the group. 

Heading out, after hearing about the nearest city being a couple hours north, they are briefly stopped by the Tripkee front guards to check for contraband before heading down the path in the storm. The trip was mostly peaceful, minus an attempted ambush by the mangroves crocodiles.

Arriving in the city of Dondri the group finds their way to the guild house, looking for work and a dry space to actually read through the notes from their raid on Elara's library. The documentation shows the entire "discovered island" escapades. About how it was grounding a hidden layline to Luminae, the realm of the eidolons. How the mortal's gods are divine yet mortal beings who could be defeated like any other being and all of Elara's plans to use the layline to become the new gods of this realm.

Realising the severity of the documents, yet without sources to trust, the gang crashed in the guild temporary shelter to rest, ready to venture to earn some gold in the morning

### Session 3
Awoken by a surprise visit by guild member officials with a band of backup surrounding their temporary quarters, the team are met with an confused Commander Amathist demanding to know why the Tomebound are trying to use this guild house to enact their laws. She informs the crew that the Tomebound have declared them allies of Elara Mistweaver, however given the groups brazen lax of security around their highly classified documents combined with still carrying around the stolen bags of holding with trackers within them... She has her doubts.

The team explain their situation, how they were just opportunistic escapees using the chaos to escape the expendables programme and prison. Amathist seemed unfazed, willing to supply the crew with a small collection of conveniences: a reasonable sum of money, an easy disposal of the tracking devices and anti-scrying plates, and in exchange, giving the guild the documentation about the island and battleplans of Elara.

This exchange was mildly interrupted by the Dragonborn Charlie's investigations discovering Gourdy's strange arcane signature, being covered by a strong enchantment to disguise it as Fae magic, at which friend revealed themselves; revealing that both Gourdy and Friend were, to some degree, tied to Eidolon magic, confirming Charlie's theory that the layline being open would have left proof of its existence.

Saying their goodbyes after their trade, the team gets out of Dondri after tossing the trackers on a specified boat and heading out on their bounty to find the missing traders. A quick visit to the Dewmines, the home of the Ratfolk teaches them that the trader, Spirit, a Tengu traditional trader of magical items had not arrived in a few days, and the minotaur trader of rare materials should be on the way today was also late. 

After trading some frozen fish for some Ratfolk mushroom cuisine, the team heads south to spend the night and inquire at the traders previous stop, the Lizard Lounge of Lagomouth

### Session 4
Arriving in the Lizardkin village of Lagomouth, our adventurous find themselves finally able to take time to themselves, not hounded this moment by guilds or country. In this village-surrounded hot spring, the crew sign customary fake names on the entry forms and take to resting for the next day.

A venture around a trinket bazaar have them pick up a Purifying Teaspoon to ensure meals on the go, followed by a few hours lounging in the hot springs sharing stories and memories until the sun was well below the horizon. After paying for a meal of a surreal amount of sushi varieties and lodging in the taverns adventure's suite, the crew drop for a few more drinks, some magical, some for a taste of home, and relax in actual beds for their first actual nights rest.

### Session 5
Taking their leave from Lagomouth, the crew head out to continue their trader trail. Making their way to the great bridge connecting the two islands they inquire with the local ferry crews to learn that, yet again, the traders hadn't made their way over the bridge. Traversing over and enjoying the sights, they meet the same ferry crews and they never even reached the bridge. 

Taking their leave and heading towards the fey wild layline major port-town, they stumble upon one of the Cultural trader caravans surrounded by a collection of city guards. Verifying their bounty with the guild, they allow the group to investigate. They find tracks going deep into the nearby forests, a small countries fortune of rare metals and leathers, and a druidic symbol the traders interact with to mark their passing, which spirit had not passed.

Tracking the hoofprints deep into the woods, they find evidence of a fight leading to a small encampment of a collection of clerics and champions, with the two traders tied up in the middle along with the other trader caravan. Getting as close as they can without getting spotted and without asking questions, the crew knock out as many paladins as they can and free the traders, healing the minotaur enough to join the fight.

Level up to level 4!

### Session 6
Looking for answers, the group rounded up the survivors of the battle before talking to the traders, finding that these were Rani Champions and paladins. An inventory check finds that all of spirits wares are accounted for, if not muddled and disorganised. Confused, the team awoke one of the paladins who was uncooperative, trying to cast an identify magic spell multiple times on Gourdy but was interrupted by the first of centaur fury. 

The few bits of information they did learn was vague at best. The paladins seemed to be on the hunt for a "blasphemous" object. One that they could not describe, but were using a bulky arcane identifier to discover it. Unconvinced and unable to get many other answers, the crew knocked the paladin back unconscious before the guards summoned to assist arrive.

After answering their questions, the squad regroup with the traders and collect two Trader Tokens, and are offered a range of powerful magical items to take as gifts before partying ways. The crew head to the feyline city of Thirthrit to hand in the bounty, earning 150g and a request to catch up with Amathist crew. 

The meeting was brief, with Scotch, the grey herengon (rabbit) dropping by to check in about the Rani paladins operations. Sharing what they knew, scorch remarks about how despite the situation, it was generally better news than they had hoped and leave the crew with well wishes before they are freed to go find somewhere to eat and rest.

### Session 7
The crew take some downtime! Euphrosyne and Eaone work on creating Plate Mail for two days at a local forge. Izumi and Kaelam try and learn anything about curses via the many adventure markets here, but only find magical items. And Shu finds work as a healer to earn a chunk of money.

Equipped with new gear, the crew search for a new bounty to continue earning their keep. Picking up A bounty of a missing artefact, they head out to meet up with the research guild who issued it. A trip that took a brief pause to deal with a Melixi swarm with shocking efficiency and without civilian casualty.

They meet up with the researcher Tilli, a Nagaji who told the group about their missing artefact, an arcane focus attuned to an "unknown" type of arcana, that had been stolen from the guilds internal safe boxes. The main vault lock had been magically opened with some sort of divine magic, where the safebox itself had been forcefully smashed. 

An inquiry about local recent events also discover that the researchers had had a recent investor that acted incredibly odd, offering a significant amount of money with very brief talks and yet to be seen again.... but with only that to go with, the crew take their leave to try and chase up any leads they could find. 

### Session 8
Having found lots of suspicious and little direction, the crew were about to head out to the adventurer's guild to update Amathist and her crew of the overlapping interested when Friend decided to go on a solo mission. Chasing them down, friend disappears into a window of a local observatory being help up by guards who claim they're actors of the state, who seem quick to jump to murder … however a minor scuffle later and some awful persuading, their back-up turns on them.

Free to explore, the group explain the wonders of the mortal world to a confused Euphrosyne and find an array of suspicious activities. A collection of story books of the Luminae series opened to random pages, the arcane focus transformed into an arcane lens, a weird magical rock shard, and a message confirming Elara's theories written by and unknown party... and put a note offering a meeting with the unknown party.

Confused and concerned, the party return to their goal of heading to the guild house and get in contact with Charlie, transferring what they've learned to the understandably distressed dragonborn. They make plans to return the focus anyway to remove suspicion and head back out into the city...

### Session 9
The crew return the focus to a deeply confused and impressed researcher who was full of questions about not only where it was found but how they were able to find it so quickly. Fascinated by Eaones familiar, they request to stay in contact encase they could use someone who is so attuned to this "unfamiliar" source.

Taking their leave with a signed bounty, they take their 3rd trip across the city and find the Feycity's warbands setting up a self-ran festival, showing off the new inventions and tech they had brought or invented to attract further investors or customers. The crew opt to not join the festivities and earn a little extra cash after being invited to brawl with a Tomebound-brought automaton.

Handing in their bounty for a 150 gold, the crew check the festivities and local stores for any extra high quality gear, collecting a musket staff and staff of healing before resting for the night. 

A new day, a new bounty. The team go looking for the latest missions when a tTngu burst through the door desperate to hire adventures. A local science lab has been over-run with escaped experiments of their lead researcher studying the curse of lycanthropy and vampirism, and the crew jump on the opportunity to help, catching a Rotli that chases through the city to deliver them at the laboratories doorstep. 

### Session 10
The crew are fighting through the laboratory of plant gremlins. Not much to add in the way of story due to the nature of combat-heavy sessions

### Session 11
Storming into the final room in the laboratory, the crew use the professors unique changes to the curse to obliterate the plants with some scrap shards of mithril. Saving the small Rat who introduced himself as Professor Bigglewizz, they discuss the professors... unique perspective on the world. 

He eagerly tells the party about curses, being magical effects that are self-sufficient, how the Syndicate's pirates are commonly lycanthropes and such, when Izumi asks about his sisters affliction.  While unable to provide any immediate help, the fact his sister was unable to be cursed via the most common methods implies something is cursing her externally, leading the party to keep an eye of for Spider lily plants, being the only locational tie to her sisters curse. 

Using the mithril to clear out the remaining plants, the crew claim their bounty and pick up a mystery about a key with an unknown use, and take the rest of the day off to recuperate. Izumi goes to lookout for clues to chase down, while Euphrosyne and Eaone work on inscribing runes into the centaurs great sword. 

The next day they head out of the city, narrowly avoiding a short dwarven man Euphrosyne seemed to recognise and met Hera, the Dragonborn lady who had the unusual key, adored with dragon symbolism without any obvious lock to open. 

Level up to Level 5!

### Session 12

Given free range of the house to explore, the team split up to hunt down clues about where this key could be used. The crew finds:

• The key was held in the hands of a deer-headed fey creature, kneeling holding a coin that sat a signature stylised pillow. Under the pillow the coin had inscribed "In Trickery there is Trust" 
• The lower area of the manors smell faintly of moss and rock as if they were in a cave 
• The office and reading room had a weird amount of books about diplomacy and history, particularly around important draconic and fey figures 
• There was a bunch of common Elemental plains trinkets, the kind of stuff you would want if you were living there but would otherwise be mundane
• The plants in the gardens tell the crew there's some large cavern somewhere under the manor
• In the attic was a large portrait of a grand, very dragon-esk dragonborn with elk-like horns, the title "The Baron" under it in Common, and under it in Draconic "Wishes is Wealth". 
• A lot of the windows in the manor have the garden foliage pointed in a way that allows a view of the Well in the garden, to the point it feels a little weird how shaped the garden is, and at the bottom of the well was a small collection of coins that had gathered up overtime 

Putting some of the clues together, they toss a coin down the garden well, opening a hidden stone pathway into where the basement of the manor. Finding a plain stone room with a door at the end with a matching statue of a draconic creature in the same pose, holding a similar coin which had inscribed "In fire there is Warmth". Putting the Key on the pillow, the door opens, revealing and activating a portal to somewhere unknown...

### Session 13

Stepping through the portal, they find themselves in a opulent room full of deactivated portals to unknown places in the world. An unknown voice demanded to understand their intent before revealing and introducing themselves as The Observer. A Shadowfell Aiskari who calls people by titles, who seems to have the ability to passively observe the memories of those around them. 

They give them a "tour" of the location, calling it "The Nexus". Showing the party and Hera a sleeping dragon infused with both elemental and Fey magic named "His majesty", and shares that this is a place of diplomacy between the different realms. He quietly tries to separate the crew, which Izumi somehow resists. 

Each member of the part gets a simultaneous yet private conversation with the Observer. Kaelam the Planeswalker, Izumi the Realmbender, Euphrosyne The gift of the midsummer courts, Eaone the Awakened soul and Shu the Wandering spirit.

These conversations mostly involve the observer collecting the parties insights and clear their mind of their many thoughts, as their initial observations saw an adventuring party of many origins, which would be of value to the goals of The Nexus. 

They shares a few bits of key detail for the entire party, notably that he, and seemingly all of the important figures of the shadowfell are privy to the secrets the guild is holding, and yet they are keeping their aligned goals a secret. They also updates the party that the Tomebound are using them as a way to try and mitigate Elara's influence, making them well known criminals within the nation which massively hinders their ability to be of immediate help to the nexus.

 As a parting note, they grant each of the members of the party a custom gift as well as grant and party a magic key that would allow them to return to the Nexus at any time. They request they return when their name has been cleared within the Tomebound. Taking their leave out the front door, the crew head to the nearest sign of civilisation, briefly meeting a follower of Phynitir who offers to join the party temporarily, which he then turns down after the party's insightful questions get a bit too much. 

### Session 14

Heading up to the castle, the crew are intercepted by a small band of Catfolk in matching outfits who query about when the crew made it to the island. After a lot of internalised and silent flack after Euphrosyne's instinctual lie about swimming here, Shu convinces the patrol is a half-truth, that a teleportation effect warped them to the isle.

After checking their bags for any obvious contraband or obvious criminal activlity, they inform the group that there's no more boats out of the island today, but they could find lodging in Castle Farcaster, the outpost their warband occupies.

The crew take their leave to the castle, finding the gate open and meeting a ratfolk who welcomes them and lets them know where they can find a place to rest, and while he doubts there work for them, they can contact "Big Dog" in the castle to see if there's anything they can do. 

After yet more internalised and silent discussion about how to introduce themselves, they finally meet Big Dog, a centaur-sized German Shepard in a armoured kilt, who lets the crew know that while he doesn't have work, the castle has a ton of spare supplies they can help themselves on if they wish to help themselves to make use out of it. 

With nothing better to do, the crew collect themselves a bunch of mundane but useful trinkets and tools for essentially free as the castle collects the rest of the warband collects for the night. Before they head to bed, they are invited to check out the view from the castle walls... where an eagle-eyed Shu spotted an invisible character roaming in the fields around the castle.

Given the suspicion, the warband send them out with a patrol to try and catch the individual, however given the extreme disadvantage the party was in to catch an invisible spellcaster, they got away with the crew none the wiser about who or why for now.

### Session 15

After a brief sweep of the area the crew re-group with the patrol sent out with them to amplify the nearby island magic nullifier generator, sharing their lack of actionable trails or success. They rendezvous back in the castle and where Euphrosyne shared a full briefing with the entire warband. Without much to work with but wanting to act immediately, the Captain Big Dog gave the crew the task of moving around the nullification generators.

The crew head out in the middle of the night and upon heading to the first generator, Shu spotted a strange alloyed crystal. A mangled, inefficient arcane focus and locator that was sending arcane power vaguely deeper deeper in the island. Trying their best to follow that trail, they discovered a deeply hidden and covered grove, at which in the centre was a compass, drawing out an exact copy of the island from the ground up, including its inhabitants, massively underpowered and running incredibly slowly.

### Session 16

In the middle of the night, no oversight, and an artefact made by a legendary crafter... the crew does what any good thieves do, and dismantled it as much as they could with their low light and crafting skills. Pocketing it in their pouches, they get back to completing their task of moving around the nullifier generators without further events aside finding a few more rocks, now seemingly inert.

Reporting in to find Big Dog has taken rest for the night, the view does the same, waking at about new day to see the castle in its active state, full of tourists and visitors. They hand off the new map to Big Dog, who seems frustrated at their immediate "destruction" of seemingly vital evidence, yet lets them know the cargo ship ahs been docked awaiting them to let them off the island at their earliest convenience 

Heading out, they board the ship and take sail to Drondi, when the ship gets intercepted by a Tomebound scout craft who seems to know that there are Tomebound fugitives onboard.... 

### Session 17

The crew dismantle the Tomebound wizards from their souls, defending their freedom with a hard-fought victory, spending many of their resources to succeed. With a now unoccupied boat and nobody around to stop them... they acquire a boat, make their peace with the captain who was taking them to Dondri, and head to the capital to get the ship licenced and to be literally anywhere else. 

### Session 18

Landing in the oversized city of Wildholm, the team try and navigate their way around this city of giants. Picking up some snacks on the go and a questionable amount of alcohol, they eventually find their way to the adventurer's guild, discovering the Guild's head quarters in this part of the continent. 

They are invited for an impromptu meeting with Amathist, who's eager to learn everything related to the recent act of war by the Tomebound, along with her guest Elysia, A Kolective ambassador. They share a few details, keeping their prized contraption of environmental copying a hidden secret before Amathist suggests they should stay within the capital until things can calm down again.

They take their leave, Elysia inviting the crew out on a small tour to a quiet spot around town to talk in private and get to know each other due to obvious mutual benefits. They take the team up to the 5th district in the city centre, to a quiet, hidden away converted inn to discuss the parties story and events, as they are one of the few people in this world who's actually aware of the ploys happening in the world around them. Its here where many untold secrets about the innerworkings on the Tomebound is shared to the ambassador and a few details about the island itself before everyone finally gets some rest for the night. 

### Session 19

The team take a few days to themselves, installing tattoos, buying some equipment upgrades, earning a little cash and causing some chaos. They chase up on an Assassins bounty hunt - Shopkeeps and traders are being assassinated, and left a calling card of a golden coin with a symbol of a deer's skull, placed on the victims tounge

The team work out they seem to be killing regular traders not of Kolective origin via some sort of instant physic damage due to a lack of wounds of blood. Some sort of paralysis was also used that would weaken the mental capabilities to barely functional. 

They had some clues they could chase down - Checking alchemist's able to make paralysis's this strong, Ask the wizards station for any custom spells being crafted by the community, or visit the docks to see where the metals of these types were distributed to.... or they could summon a bloodhound to take them straight to the assassins hideout....

Finding an abandoned smithy with a hidden basement full of racism-fuelled conspiracies and vile propaganda, the team also see the plans of a current assassination in progress - targeting a shopkeep they brought from just the day before

### Session 20

Combat episode - The crew had fun murdering some stupid racists assassin, the team successful and clearing out after the Warband take over the situation

### Session 21

On their way back to the guild house, the party find themselves called by the key to the nexus - which they put on hold until they can get paid. A plan that falls a little short as the bounty can't be paid until the scope of their work is confirmed and verified by the city, a task that may take until the next day. With time to spare, the crew find a tavern in district 0 that could accommodate them all and use the wardrobe lock.

The nexus greets the party after Izumi eves drops on the ongoing conversation between The Observer, His Majesty, and a Satyr from the autumn fey wilds. A in-depth conversation insures, where the team was informed the the Mines bounty, claimed by another group of adventurers, contains an active community phylactery containing the souls of a collection of ancient Feyborn and Dragonkin, ancient enough for the celestials can't be allowed to get their hands on it now it's been brought back to light due to the power they would gain from their souls. 

They request the party ask the guild to take over this bounty and return the soul-gems within the phylactery back to the nexus so they can be returned to their realms. However, The main issue is that the disconnection of any body from soul will lose it to the celestials, and a soul that ancient will without doubt draw their attention. 

To ensure the guild will allow this party to take over an ongoing bounty, The Observer gave the crew their Aiskari Shadow-Coin to both bribe the guild and convey a chain of meaning to the guild. The crew, with promises of future dividends and a replacement of Izumi's gift, take on the task and head to the build the next day

They show up to the guild and receive their pay-out from the assassins and request an impromptu meeting with Amathist. They seem to immediately recognise the coin, and have many questions and even more concerns. She allows the party to take over the quest, but assigns them a handler -a Bluebird Tengu named Scout, who seems shockingly optimistic about the situation.... despite everything. 

### Session 22

The crew head to the ruins with Scout on watch - for about 4 seconds before the crew immediately turn off the rings used to track their progress and observations - abandoning the guilds sole request made since their first meeting. Given the nature of the mission and the fragility of the skeletons, the party split up to find the phylactery as fast as possible after Izumi sends an invisible servant through the temple to scout without being seen to establish branching routes for the party to take.

Gourdy and Shu are the first to find the objective - able to quickly smuggle it into a bag of holding to disconnect soul from body as the rest of the party is spread out across the dungeon - the threat and objective removed, they see what they can find hidden around this now long-forgotten place

The crew find:
 • **A Deep well** leads to an ancient hidden room resembling a pathway to the nexus - The room is lit by 4 Everlight crystal powered lanterns
• An **abandoned market place** where coins from a bygone era can were collected.
• A **communal meeting hall** with A working Flask of Fellowship and a Maestro's Instrument (flute)
• A **drowned smithy** containing a "Flaming Star" (Ancient dragon scale)
• A **basic Training room** with abandoned safety gear - a pair of Backfile Mantles and A pair Bracers of Missile Deflection
And A corpse compass, seemingly used by a skeleton to ensure that the denizens are still alive. 

The phylactery secured and the dungeon picked clean, the party regroup ready to return the lost souls back to the nexus

### Session 23
The party opens the door to the nexus to hand-off the souls, only to find that putting the souls inside a bag of holding had disconnected Soul from Body, effectively "killing"  the souls and trapping them in the bags sub-dimension stopping them from escaping to the divine. Without much the choice, Shu leaves the bag behind for the Nexus to discover the best way to extract the souls safely. 

The observer, in his endless telepathy, realises the crew had been incredibly secretive and pushing their luck with the guild, despite the guild being on edge about the crews allegiance. He warns the party that their lives are on the lines and keeping an ally of the guild would remain the best course of action 

The squad sheepishly head out, straight into the arms of Scout, who had abandoned their post instantly to watch the crew in person. Being the main person reporting back to the guild, and being typically sent on missions to confirm traitors of the guild, is over the moon that the crew arn't traitors, just incredibly strange, and is eager to help put in a good word so she can finally keep her squad.

With a final check of a secret room Scout has spotted, the crew head back to the city to hand in the bounty and take some time off

### Session 24
The party takes some well earned downtime - Runes are applied by Talifus onto Euphrosyne's armour and Eaone's spell Focus while Izumi and Kaelam head to the library to see what they can learn about the Kolective and the origin of Spider Lillys. Shu finds the holy grail of Aeon stone stores - equipping himself with two new gems. 

These adventures recombine at lunch to meet with Scout who had smuggled out documents relevant to the party to get them updated to the situations - The ways the Amamthist had protected the party behind closed doors and the struggles of Elaras Cult and the religious misguided hunt. 

They end the day reading the magical books they collected from the ruins, turn their everlight crystals into lanterns and torches, and try and discover the value of the ancient coins they found

### Session 25
Without any immediate plans, the half the team head into the city to learn more about the other parties involved in this entire mess, particularly seeking to learn more about the gods and their worshipers, while Izumi and Kealam hit up the library again.

The crew find a "Church" of the Hydrathir, which given the layout and architecture of the city displays more as an office building where services and rooms are organised per person rather than grand sermons - Which there being an apparently split between servicing "traditionalists" and  more modern means. They take time to learn what they can about the god and their service, and also seek to get their boat blessed from the recommendation of a cleric. 

The book boys look into more about the guild and how it functions to minor success, and try to find out how islands of that size and scope could even float - and come up short. It does inspire the idea that maybe Izumis dreams themselves can be explored to see what information can be learned in the spaces he's been pulled into

The crew head back to reconvene at a spa, however Euphrosyne gets jumped by a fey trap to lure her back to the fey wild, a trap that's denied by astronomical sheer mental will of Euphrosyne, which an onlooking Saytr from the nexus seemed surprised that they didn't need to step in after tracking the assailants. 

### Session 26
With the nightmare dodged and the crew relaxed(?) at the spontaneous spa visit, they set off to close out the last two tasks of the day - watch the boat blessing, and visit the museum to see if the fey coins had been evaluated. 

The afternoon turns into a museum trip as the rest of the coins are verified for their validity, the crew spending time looking at this history of the Kolective, and walk away 825 gold richer from the raw material value of the currency!

The boat blessing gives them time to also mount their stolen ballista from before they were a crew to the boat, arming it with siege weaponry before the cleric arrives, whos blessing seemed either ineffective or ignored - an uncomfortable omen given the circumstances.

The night ends, and yet begins, as Izumi bends the realms of his dreams to try and summon his allies - of which Euphrosyne (and Gourdy) fell from the boundless sky into the ocean over minutes, while the rest of the team stayed by Izumis side on his island in the sky. They rush to the isles edge, spotting the vauge idea of an unknown city that seemingly can't grasp reality in this moment. 

They rush to the edge to try and discover their location - at which izumi walks off the edge into the sky, seemingly lost in another reality or part of the dream, pressing on to see a different edge, one filled with islands spanning the sky before the dream ruptures and ends. 

### Session 27 - 28 - 29 (The Festival of Plenty)
The crew awake into the Festival of Plenty! With food and plant-based resources being produced on mass in the city, festivals are held to offload all the excess so it doesn't go to waste! The crew stock up, especially an excessive amount of watermelon before jumping into the festivities: 

#### **Cowardice**
A gambling game where the players must be a coward and dip out at the right time - a bar is set, and a D1000 is rolled. If the dice roll above the bar, the game continues, if not, the run ends and everyone who dipped out that round wins!

The team just kept committing and lost over a gold in gambling, minus Kaelam who actually won a few silver. 

#### **The City Slicks**
The waterways that manage the rain in the city are intentionally flowing with water to allow for boat races from the top to the bottom of the city. Riders need to balance both speed and staying in the shallow canal as it bends and curves down the Wildholm streets

The team scored a total of 38! Choosing to either absolutely send it in acceleration, or full break to make it around corners, barely scraping by on many bends but completing the race!

#### **Fairy Shenanigans**
While on their way to explore around the city more, the crew stumble upon a pair of fairies who pull a "prank" of bringing the produce "life", swelling in size as they stumble around attacking civilians. The team take care of the Mellon Men, Puff Persons, Aspariguys and Blue Boys with relative ease, but in the chaos lose sight of the fey that caused it. 

#### **Mystic Morgon The All-Seeing Gorgon**
A gorgon with the power to see into the weave of time - able to tell people their futures, not determined, but of the one most travelled, assuming there is a common river flow.

Euphrosyne learns that her future will see her constantly in battle between her personal ideologies and the groups in the world through a true belief of doing the greater good. 

Eaone's immediate future sees no path most travelled, but the infinite threads all seemed to converge where their past will come back to haunt them, some paths way sooner than others. 

Izumi had the strongest river, as greater forces are guiding him to their goals. Unlike the divine though, the most common manipulators of peoples fate, this river is weak enough to be easily defied 

Shu's fate, by his very nature is almost riverless - being a free sprit in both literally and figuratively. The many paths spawl in wild and different paths, where looking down any too far strays too far to be of useful information. 

Kaelam, being a draconic creature should have their weave frozen. And yet, their weave moves. Slowly unwinding as time slowly reclaims them, as concerning as that is. 

#### **The Shadowlife**
A Shadowfell creature runs a game where you can pretend to survive in the Shadowfell, choosing to either Hide from or Trust the strange situations and creatures they are presented. Intentionally vague, strange, confusing or weird to make the game feel more like chance that intent

Euphrosyne was the only member in the party to win the entire sequence - passing all 6 scenarios, the final one by such a small margin!

#### Badass Brawlers
A combat arena where the warbands seem to be recruiting people who show their might - a defence drone covered in shields turn damage into number, and a panel of judges score the style, strength or dexterity of the attack to combine to a final score. One of the parties from Castle Farcaster is there, which the crew hang out with for a bit, learning about auxiliary units before they throw down in the arena.

Euphrosyne scored a 63. Kaelam, 77. Izumi, 84, and Eaone won, with a stunning display of 107. 

These displays caused the team to be approached the rest of the night by warbands, pitching them being a part of their auxiliary team, as the displays blew expectations out of the water

#### A small tangent
Eaone was approached on the way to Badass Brawlers by a vixen, a famous Biomancer named Kacsy. A brief conversation offers Eaone to come to their saloon if they so wish, as her clients have seen Eaone around the city and their unique features as an Isolight have been in demand. Kacsy seemed oddly apologetic, as it seemed she was prepared to ask someone who had been under biomancy their source, and not an Isolight, and had to rapidly pivot their planned pitch on the fly.

Eaone was also invited to visit Big Dog at his home in the outskirts of the city - another connection between Isolights. They share conversation about their origins as Isolights and how Big Dog has been collecting a small community of them - finding the people in their life that wronged them. The issue however, is Eaone was unaware of someone in their life like that, but game BD enough clues that there was someone - the lich - worth investigating. 

BD also shared his backstory, how he was awoken to serve his master, the arch-mage Tellarum as a bodyguard against whatever forces hunt down archmages. He ultimate failed in his duty as an assault of 40 assassins were sent upon the tower, being the sole survivor along with 5 of the assailants: 
> Eaksati Afriani
> Terrli Holly
> Grangi Guts
> and the brothers Askri and Entri Perco

He asks Eaone that if they learn any details about these people to let him know as soon as possible, and he will look out for them in kind. 

The final tangent was Scout catching up with the crew, hanging out a bit but also letting them know that there's still not much movement on the Elara front - a few moves but they're sending in adventures on disruption bounties to try and delay or dismantle them as they work. 

#### The Drinking Run 
As night falls the streets of Wildholm become home to many stalls offering unique alcohols - if you down at least a shot glass worth, you earn an arm band, and the crew head out to try and collect as many as they can.

Euphrosyne won after 18 glasses as Kealam just barely had to tap out at 17. Izumi quit willingly 8 drinks in, and a critical failure from Eaone saw them wipe out at 10. 

With the team wiped out, drunk, a plant or a horse, the team find somewhere to crash for the night and prepare to make the most of their new resources come the morning. 

### Session 30
Izumis night is interrupted with another vision, one that takes him deep into an abandoned town on the mountain border between Kolective and Ebonstar. This town previously hidden by an ancient,. powerful rune now lays dormant, with many questions and few answers. The vision is cut short as Izumi's exploration of a ritual site is interrupted by a masked figure who compels him back into his sleeping body - incidentally revealing the location of the city relative to him.

The morning crew hit the town post festivities and clean out adventures stores left and right. Most of the crew now maxing out or nearing the limit of the arcane investment capabilities. Seriously too many items were brought to bother listing, but the crew got kitted up!

the evening saw a visit to Kasey the Biomancer, where the ethics and world of biological modification was explained and explored - one where Eaone opted to agree to an exclusivity deal in exchange for sharing their unique looks. 

### Session 31
The crew prepare to take leave of Wildholm by installing the ship upgrades from parts they brought or collected from the festival, setting up their ship to be a moving crafting station and place of rest. Upgrading the engine, armour, hull, and purchasing magical figurehead that lets them change the ships appearance, a long day of work turns the repurposed ship into a faster and more useful vehicle.

With their newly improved vessel, they take sail to the mountains of Ebonstar, a long journey interrupted by beings of the sea which the team dealt with after a long scrap. 

### Session 32
The party arrives in the Southern Ebonstar town of Mountport - seemingly the main stop of trade between the Ebonstar and the Kolective, and the crew experience the immediate culture shock of this new empire. Reputation as a numeric currency - one that is used for social standing, expectation and power. Earned and trading by companies for providing a service to another, the amount of public services offered for free or to as many people as possible to earn reputation on-mass. 

The crew spend some time setting up the group as a company and earning some rep themselves until the day closes, finding that some Halvaxus paladins had headed out to the very city they sought. Hiring a landship in the morning to cover half the journey before putting their hands into Izumi's incredible +0 survival skills to navigate the savannas to find the location only he saw in his dreams - a place found just bearly before sunset.

They enter the city quietly to find all three paladins dead, no sign of battle or trauma aside the multi-story fall from the upper city, a fall that was not the cause of death but the result of it. they make their way up, finding the paladins encampment who had ransacked most of the city before them. 

The ritual site Izumi saw was now compelled crudely by the paladins and contained a sword Izumi had seen many, many times in their dream, which when touched, merged the dreaming and waking world into one, revealing a battle between the paladins sprits and unknown kitsune and human monks


### Session 33
Izumi relishes in the newfound but temporary power of the artifact they had manifested in their dreams many times before as the party dispatch of the remnants of these paladins, carrying them out of the sacred city so they can stop assaulting the monks, closing the dream realm and returning this ancient city to its natural, decaying state. 

A rest later, the team go hunting for clues, able to translate the ancient common the notebooks were written in, discovering the knowledge of 4 clans seeking enlightenment via different means and how the divine seemed to stop their experiments, to a degree. The rune that hid the city was found and restored, but the main ritual circle was pretty hard to translate being butchered into completion via the paladins handiwork.

Taking their leave with the knowledge they could find and a new artifact, the party head back - trekking through the savannahs, overhearing the news about the Tomebound denying the creation of a new city despite the obelisk forges being active. 

Their trip back was interrupted by a surprise visitor through Gordy, the eidolon that awoken them now able to speak through them but temporarily due to their proximity to the layline, able to use Gourdy to communicate. They expected the crew to be so close seeking aid, especially as they had brought one of the awakened creatures near the layline, but the crew kinda didn't need them right now, and when offered the ultimate bounds of creation, asked for a sandwich, and more of the strange rocks they had found in the observatory and isle - along with a powerful gift for Shu.

### Session 34
The crews return home was interrupted with a surprise visit from a cursed pirate skeleton crew. The conversation is an odd one, with the pirates reiterating a few times they only want the dark steel the team had on them. The crew agree if they could get an few hours to remove the runes on them, which will take a few hours, so they play the Fae card game of Uno.

This odd diversion ends as oddly as it starts, the crew wondering if they have the ability to summon these fellows again as they arrive back at Wildholm, finding somewhere much cheaper to dock their ship. Their attempt to meet with Amathist are unsuccessful, but Euphrosyne collected a letter from their parents and go find somewhere nice to read it.

The crew link up with Scout in a district 5 park, at which scout demands to know more about our team after experiencing so many oddities that the team brushes off without question. The Nexus, the Eidolons, the weird dreams - so many questions she has about our odd little team until she finally runs out of questions, suggesting to go get food

After finding a tavern, the satyr from the Nexus links up with the team, wanting to make a small point of showing up without bad news or tasking, but also a gift from Euphrosyne's parents - a brooch that when the wearer would take lethal damage would warp them back to the fey wilds, something Euphrosyne has suspicions about.

### Session 35
After spending the night and reconnecting with Eaone, the party get their meeting with Amathist, however instead of discussing their happenings they are being sent on a high importance operation - the sabotage of a Tomebound Obelisk Forge being actively overrun by an outfit of Elara's goons. Its unclear what Elara wants the obelisks for, but they are incredibly powerful creations.

The team are tasked to infiltrate the forge, collect whatever documents are valuable, learn everything they can with the benefit of knowing what they do, and plant a high explosive device onto the obelisk to destroy it along with the forge. 

The team are re-introduced to Elyssa, the Kolective official overseeing the operation, Eesk, the Kobold Bomb expert, and Tyreen, a powerful caster who can transport the team near the objective, before being given a lump of gold to buy and prepare for the operation.

In turn, the team set up a plan:

After scouting for a day or two to understand the outposts operation, they lure our a small detachment with a nearby camp soke signal. After knocking one out and dispatching the rest, cast Mental Map and Duplicate on them to learn everything they need and have a spy in their ranks, equipped with drugged smoke bombs. 

They then drink invisibility potions and sneak into the control room, jam the door shut and execute everyone inside while the duplicate drug-bombs the gathering reinforcements for the fight to roll to the main external area. With two areas cleared and hopefully no reinforcements on the way, rush the forge to clear our the final unaware survivors to give them time to rummage for everything the place has.

What could possibly go wrong!
### Session 36
The team get shopping for their kit, hunting down everything they need and crafting their devices before being transported to the wilderness a while out from the forge. On their way, they can't help but notice a local deer is following them and us rather unskittish for a typical prey animal. 

Taking a gamble, Eaone reaches out to the deer with a greeting, at which the druid reveals themselves, asking to know their allegiance to the nearby forge, as they have been incredibly hostile to nature in the area. The team express their goals of the forges destruction, and the druid offers them a safe space to stay if they help with their hunt for a Mokele -  a rare and elusive giant lizard that has moved into the territory.

Kealam, friend of dragons, then proceeds to roll 4 natural 20's to hunt down the giant lizard, finding its hidden lair in an underwater cave, which they inform the druids about upon returning to the grove, discovering the circle of druids here who seem to be studying and perfecting a perfect wild shaping transformation in both visual and behaviour

### Session 37
With a safe space to spend the night the crew take leave to the forge to begin scouting operations. Before they head out however, the druids inform them that they have some sort of detection system that lets them know about living creatures that get near. 

With this, the crew find with Kaleams heightened perception a small device that sends a signal when a living creature crossed its invisible beam set up in a basic circle, at which they easily disable one of them in the chain to allow passage in and out.

Using Izumi's invisible minion combined with the ability to share vision to roam around the grounds unseen, they get a headcount and isolate the leader and discover how the ritualists summon reinforcements and cycle the guard every hour with a portal. They also learn how a gateway to the elemental far lands to run the forge and the prevention of draconic interference. Nothing major that will change their plans, but valuable information none the less

The crew step away and prepare to execute their master plan...

#### Session 38
The fire lit and the plan begun, a scouting crew quicky fall to the party's hands. However they are momentarily distracted by a strange crystal that appears when the wizard dies, seeming to capture their soul. Euphrosyne pockets one from the unconscious goon before getting back on track.  Invisibility potions drunk and and arriving in the control room, the party make work of the control room, alerting the external guards as expected, now having a time limit on when reinforcements arrive. 

The boss takes a while to drop but the rest of her goons drop like flies, the squad clearing out the wizards without much issue as spells fail to do meaningful damage, crystals flying up and charging with every strike.

A time limit that seems to get delayed as a critical persuasion check by the double controlled by Eaone, leading the crew into the unaware forge where the elemental realm portal ritualists resides, alerting them to the issues on the other side of the foundry in an attempt to drug them too, an attempt that fails and groups every ritualist together for the upcoming fight... 

#### Session 39
The brawl continued, the crew making fast work of the stragglers grouped around the door and their burst of harm spells - and for good reason, the ritualists in the forge were summon reinforcements and they are against the clock. Sprinting across the courtyard at unreasonable speeds and a Gust of wind ambush defeated, the crew start culling the numbers, but not soon enough to prevent an automaton entering the fight.

the reinforcements lasted 2 rounds before the portal could be forced closed, two huge automaton frames controlled by a single core providing an actual threat between the swarm of novice wizards. The fight ends with the party victorious and many wizards dead - its unknown how much time they have, but they have the time to start stripping this legendary forge for anything it has

### Session 40
The team find themselves having to wait for the forge to generate Oblilum at a painfully slow rate, with every minute they spend there risking reinforcements who could sabotage the bomb they intend to setoff - but first they have to deal with a new issue that's showed up - A red dragon - one that seems to know kealam

A conversation happens in draconic as the rest of the team preps to defend themselves - with Kaelam having to rapidly explain that they're not working with Elara, the portals open because they don't know how to close it. The dragon then transforms into their visage form and introduces themselves as Dusaph in very struggled common and invite them to join him in the elemental realm to work out the story they've been told about our party vs the truth. A Trip the Hatter can't take, and take theirs leave to go hunt down "The other half of the story"

The team does buy enough time with what goodwill they have to collect what Oblilum they can - with Euphrosyne finding a way to get the forge to dump everything it has in stockpile, jamming it in the process but giving them enough material to make themselves more than they could have asked.

Taskalak - an Adult Black dagon grants the team enough ground to protect them from the heat of the farlands before offering them a ride through the elemental realms, arriving at the the farlands Border City of Far'setto'ard'ndsis - where the crew try and find somewhere to stay temporarily while meetings are organised - meeting the scientist Dezshara, who seems as excited to see outsides as they are to see them.

It becomes quickly apparent though that this city is not designed for them - and while attempts are made to offer the old miserable tomebound research buildings as housing, the team find an appropriate place to set up Gourdy-house and rest for what should be the night.
