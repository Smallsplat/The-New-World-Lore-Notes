### Pouch of Crafted Gestures,
A rough bag made of canvass, leather or other work material. It can hold up to 3 bulk. This bag magically assists in the creation of heart-warming trinkets that help make an impression. 

Make a crafting check with a DC equal to a Task Level your choice, you can spend an hour to create a 1 bulk trinket with the items within the bag. This check can be made on the move and can be split into different parts. Regardless of the DC check, all items in the bag are used. 

Critical Success: Your attempt is successful. The trinket provides an Item bonus equal to quarter the Task level (minimum of 1), +1 non-stackable circumstance bonus to make an impression or similar diplomacy check when gifted to a creature. 
Success: Same as a Critical but without the +1 bonus. 
Failure: You fail to create a trinket, and all items and resources in the bag are lost. 
Critical Failure: Same as failure, but the bag is unable to create trinkets until a long rest.

When a trinket is gifted to a creature, the trinket loses its magical effect. These trinkets hold the same value as the resources used to craft them + One day in the Income earned table, up to double the base resource cost. For example, a Expert crafter who succeeds in crafting a Task level 5 trinket using 50sp worth of materials will make a +1 trinket worth 1gp.

### Bracers of Cunning Apparition: 
Usage: worn; Bulk -
A pair of silver bracers. A red glass-like gem adorns each bracer. The contents of the gem swirl hypnotically with the slightest movement, as if encasing a void of endless stars.
##### Thousand-Faced Apparition
Activate: Change Shape; 
Duration: 1 minute / sustained; 
Effect: You take a Step, Stride or Sneak action, an illusory duplicate of your previous form appears where you were standing for 1 minute. Only one duplicate can be active at any time. The duplicate is highly detailed and has no obvious visual tell of it being an illusion; creatures with no way to see through illusions must touch it, strike it, or use seek to attempt to disbelieve it, unless it does an action that would otherwise be obviously physically impossible without additional effects.

Whenever you move as part of this effect or Sustain it, you may instruct the illusion to: 
• Create a Diversion, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check 
• Feint, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check 
• Stride, Crawl, Drop Prone, Leap, Stand, Hide, Sneak, Swim, Take Cover, or other movement-based actions
• Feign Interaction, with a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check to believe the action was successful, such as pressing a button or activating a pressure plate, until there is enough evidence to prove otherwise.
A creature does not automatically disbelieve the illusion on a failed deception attempt. 

If you Change Shape into a form of the same size and the same ancestry trait (humanoid to humanoid for example), you can roll a Deception check against the Perception DC of all creatures observing you to shed your duplicate without anyone noticing. 
On a success, you become Hidden to them.  On a failure, or upon changing to a form of a different size, there is a 50% chance (a 1 or 2 on a d4) that the observer will target the duplicate, unless they have seen through the illusion via other means or have reasonable intent otherwise.
##### Fox's Accomplice
You can spend 1 minute to create an illusory duplicate of your current form without using Change Shape or of a willing creature you can touch. Duplicates created this way have the same effect as one created by Thousand-Faced Apparition, but can be instructed to do feign a chain of up to 8 tasks of any actions or downtime activities, last 8 hours instead of 1 minute and do not dissipate when others are made.

Bulk 1 Hands 1 
Type Melee; Category Martial; Group Sword, Levelled Artifact

Sword of The Distant Shore is a levelled artifact. "Levelled artifacts level up as the wielder becomes more able to manage and wield the power the artifact contains. When a Levelled artifact is first equipped or levels up, the wielder must pick what abilities the artifact has access to, up to the artifacts current level. This choice is permanent, and learned abilities can not be unlearned. A levelled artifact can only level up as many times as it has abilities, and levels up at the GM's discretion, however typically it is after great feats. "

The Sword of The Distant Shore's abilities can be empowered using Dreamwalking. When you use one of {sword name}'s abitlies, you can Dreamwalk as a free action. To Dreamwalk, you must beat a spell skill check equal to a DC40 Minus the total of a Will Saving throw.

You can Dreamwalk as many time per day {sword name}'s artifact level.

*Critical Success: As success, and the range increases by 60ft* 

**1 Action: Mass Figmentation**
 Once per day, You summon figments of yourself behind all enemies within 60ft until the end of your next turn. These figments are believed until you take damage or the figment is struck or inspected. These figments count for flanking bonuses.

*Dreamwalk:*
*Success: The range increases by 30ft, 
*Critical Success: The range increases by 60ft and you may swap position with any figment created by this effect immediately, leaving a copy where you were and making targets within 5ft of you flat-footed until you next attack*

**Free action: Quickcharge**
When you recharge your spell strike, you step into the dreaming realm, letting you teleport up to your speed as a free action.

### Idyllic Seed of Creation 

Unique, Artifact

A seed of pure cosmic energy, an eternal nebular moves with a seed big enough to fit the palm of a hand.

Once per day, you can do a nature check with a DC of 25. On a success, you can create new plant life to this local ecosystem that has the abilities you decide. After doing so, using this ability again in the same local ecosystem will generate the same plant. 

The plant's abilities have very few bounds, but must be within the plants physical functions and mass and abide by the world's rules - for instance, a plant that can teleport the user to another instance of it through a complex deep root system could be allowed, but a plant that teleports you to the kings treasure room for 10 minutes before returning you would not. Your GM has final say over if a plant fits within the the world.

### Globe of Figmented Skies

A small-globe shaped object with a mimicry of the night sky directly above. A small gear on the side when twisted projects the display out of the globe and into the space around it as 3 dimensional figments in a 25ft space around the globe. This can continue to scale up as twisted further, however projections 25m away from the globe disappear. 

Due to the nature of the scale of this cosmos, in the mortal planes the initial projection causes a rush of visible stars to eject from the orb immediately, requiring a DC 15 reflex saving throw or be dazzled 1 to anyone looking directly at the globe.
