### Overview
Dragons are "The Flesh of the Elementals". While elementals themselves are created by raw energy along, Dragons are the result of true life in the elemental planes. In turn, they are incredibly powerful beasts who reside in one of the many quadrants that the primordials draw with their presence. 

The Primordials themselves don't often interact with mortals due to their passive lethality, making dragons the messengers and will of the primordials. These negotiations are often one sided, as the table is normally a group of mortals versus the might of a dragon, however their demands are far and few between, and rarely disagreeable.

Since the celestial war, the Dragons have been extra quiet, hiding within Elvanus and rarely making their presence known on the mortal realms, guarding the layline and being generally unwelcoming to visitors. Their wrath only descends into the mortal realm when their mortal kin are abused; the Drakes, Wyverns, Wyrms, Amphipteres and the such. 

Dragons are still tied to the cycle of souls, however their bodies are eternal, immune to the many deceases and issues that come with age, and with the elemental plains being a place with no danger or risk to them, they can live there for centuries, as many have. 

That said, dragons still often interact with mortals though the many ways of magical communications. A few visit as polymorphed versions of themselves and stay away from prying celestial eyes, others open themselves out to be reached for sorceries or pacts, and some directly trade with mortals in exchange of their rare gifts, such as Dragon scales.

Dragon regenerate after time, however their severed limb still contains a connection to its originator, letting the dragon track down its carrier or commune through it. This can be done intentionally, letting dragons communicate with willing servants, or forced against them as prised possessions in battle, normally leading to a wrath not worthy of the reward.
