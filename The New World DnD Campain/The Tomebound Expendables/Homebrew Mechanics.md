### Modular Vehicles

While most vehicle are fit for cargo, they can be fitted to support many professions or activities, normally at the expense at the carrying capacity of the vehicle. When a vehicle becomes broken, any upgrades below deck can become subjugated to water damage, which the GM decides on if the upgrade is undamaged, repairable, or completely destroyed.

### Levelling up Vehicles

While vehicles can't level up through combat, they can increase their capabilities with monitory funding. Vehicles can only be Levelled up 3 times before reaching its maximum capabilities, and typically costs 10% of the vehicles base cost * levels above base, as well as at least 24 hours to install.

Levelling up a vehicle grants:
• +20hp (+10BT)
• +5ft Speed in its primary locomotion if applicable
• +1 AC, +1 Fortitude
• -1 Piloting Checks DC's
• 10% Bulk if applicable

### Mounting Weaponry
**Mounted** Siege Weapons can be equipped onto a vehicle, assuming there's space on the vehicle to support the weapon and there's at least 1 free mount slot.

Standard firearms and ranged weaponry can also be mounted without taking up bulk or weight. using these weapons are exactly the same as regular weapons, however you must share their tile, only one person can use the weapon per round, can only aim in a 180 arch, and does not require interact actions to holster or equip.


### Limitbreak Channelling (Free Action)
*Too long have you needed to do more, now. The art of kineticists thrive on consistency and uptime, but when those in need require help now, waiting is rarely an option. You have found a way to break your limits when channelling your elements, allowing you to burn brighter and do things otherwise impossible at the cost of everything.* 

After Channelling Elements, you can Limitbreak Channelling, granting your kinetic aura bonus effects:

• Your kinetic auras range is increased by 5ft
• Impulses gain a circumstance bonus to attack, and damage equal to your constitution bonus, and half as much to Impulse DCs. 
• Overflow Impulses no longer deactivates your kinetic aura, can be used multiple times per round, and grant a stress token
• At the end of each turn, gain a Stress token. 
• If your aura is Deactivated by any means outside of Limitbreaking, gain a stress token

Each time you gain a Stress token, the repercussions of your actions are felt instantly after the effect has resolved. You must make DC 20 + Stress Fortitude save. You can not succeed this save if you have more stress tokens than your current level or if your aura was deactivated. You lose all stress tokens on a long rest.

**Critical Success**: Same as success but you take half damage.
**Success**: You take Stress * 1d4 Damage equal to a damage type your elements have access to. This damage ignores resistances or immunities earned by kineticist feats.
**Failure**:  The same as success, and your kinetic aura deactivates immediately. You can not reactivate your Kinetic aura for as many turns as you have stress tokens.
**Critical Failure**: Same as failure, but you take double damage
