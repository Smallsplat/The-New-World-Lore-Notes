#### **Description:**
A dwarven woman with a shorter fuse and a more blunt attitude than the [[Commander]], Amathist deals with the smaller conflicts and acts as a second, sound opinion for the commander. Will happily drop all manners if someone needs to be pulled down a peg or if something needs to be done. Her name is actively spelt incorrectly as she came from underprivileged parents, and wears the misspelling as a point of pride at how far she has come.



Amathist is a 12th lvl Echo Fighter, who has learned to fragment a part of her soul through sheer will to temporarily create her echo's.
