**Port Link: - [[Dondri - NE]]**
**Beast Tribe: - Lizardfolk**

#### Overview
Lagomouth, AKA the Lizard Lounge, is both a water park and the home of the Lizardfolk. 

While being a tourist location, there are strict rules to ensure the lizard folks normal lives are not

#### Architecture
Surrounding a natural hot spring, the Lizardfolk's homes are mostly wooden structures, combining the Tripkee's Redii and nearby forestry to weave structures strong enough to withstand many storms. Directly around the hot springs are most of the commercial buildings, a large tavern, a drinking bar, a general store, a trinket bazaar and a casino.

The centrepiece is a grand stage that often remains empty but has a persistent rotation of music filling the air that seems to never loop songs within the week. The main plaza is ringed with bioluminescent lighting, between flowers and fruits and berrys that decorate the rope-like supports that trim and connect between the buildings.

Disguised as normal housing forming a ring around the centre tourist hotspot are trade by the Lizardfolk for the lizard folk, including things such as carpenters, smiths, alchemists, farmers, chefs and rune-carvers.

#### Culture
Visitors are prompted to given fake names when they enter the town. This promotes adventures and other wayward souls wanting to keep their presence a little more undercover from avoiding the town, and given the unique appearance of the common tourist is next to inconsequential to town safety

Visitors are also prompted to only reciprocate, not initiate, flirting with the Lizardfolk, even those using the amenities. This is still their home, and inappropriate guests will be treated as such.

#### Imports and Exports
The Lizardfolk are incredibly self-sufficient and don't export or import anything outside tourism. The lizard lounge is one of the biggest, independent and luxurious of the beast tribes. 

#### Cuisine
Rice and fish are the primary food of the Lizardfolk, with the exception of importing eggs from other nations better suited for farming in exchange for other goods and resources. This leads to the most diverse array of sushi's you can find in the nation. 

#### Fashion
Living on a geothermal spring, and on the south beach coast, the Lizardfolk garb is incredibly minimal. Bulky colourful shorts and soft fluffy-ish chest-vest. This light garb demands external pockets, which lead to either over-shoulder robe-like side-bags, or, the preferred tail-bags
