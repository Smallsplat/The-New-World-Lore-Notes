### Euphrosyne's Parents letter

Our Dear Euphrosyne,

Your hope for a dramatic reveal of this letter seems as hopeful as your claims of a lord of a realm you refuse to enter. 

The strength your mortal realm explorations are noted, all be it with the understanding of its fragility and temporary nature as is the curse of all of mortals petty creations. Ones as important to the ongoing of the summer courts can't merely wander into the mortal realms to seek audience with our selfish, self-centred daughter - especially when we have to deal with the fallout of your little show. And trust us when I say this - it is a show. One that many are eagerly watching. 

As your eternal guardians, let me give you advice you clearly need - return now at the peak of your influence, with lavish mortal gifts, and we can still spin this into a story that can play into our hands. 

If not, I shall no longer insult you with mere mercenaries. The goals of the summer court are bigger than this.

Your father, cold rain on a warm eve, harbinger of twenty treaties, bringer of the summer sun, wielder of the fey furies Lord Munin of the Summer Courts


--- hidden letter

Dearest Euphrosyne, first to the fray, our gift of the midsummer court! - ♥

Your father is uptight and singularly aligned - he does not see how your ventures into the mortal realm is a greater good for all of us, yourself included... but only if you return home some day safe.

I don't pretend to understand. I won't pretend to not be disappointed, but I won't lie by saying that your course is not one I support as long as your own safety is secured. You can still bring great pride to the house of the summers - word is our lord of stories is with you now - something your father can't say has happened to him yet.

As an aside, your messenger is a swift and proficient at their work. Not enough to avoid my notice, obviously, but I have left them a gift to get to your hands when appropriate. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try and ensure your safety. 

Lady Ember, truth of the western wilds, judge of seven courts, and creator of the mortal fighter! - Your mother.

p.s I am still furious at you at you encase my honeyed words made that tone too sweet.

#### Events:

Amathist meeting:
• Elysia is there to oversee the operation being generally unhappy about everything
• Tyreen is there so act as a spellcaster for the team to teleport them into the tomebound with her fox familiar
• Eesk, a Kobold is there to give the team a bomb to destroy the obelisk. The device when made looks scrapped together, but upon a closer look it's just an incredibly efficient.

The objective:

They will be teleported via portal nearby the obelisk forge. Their goal is to discover as much information as they can and sabotage the forge. The explosive device must be put directly on the obelisk, at which the team has 5 minutes to clear the area. Staying undiscovered is ideal but mostly for personal saftey - while they expect most of the wizards would be no match for the party as most Tomebound wizards aren't built for combat, the sheer number of them may overwhelm the party. 

They expect that they have been using the obelisk forges as an outpost too, so information, documentation, artifacts and similar items are high value and as much should be extracted as possible before detonation.

The party is tasked to get ready for the mission - both with equipment and information on the objective. They should assume they are going in with the need to quietly remove and defend themselves from many spellcasters. Silent communication, ways to move around without being detected, a way to clear the blast zone when they're done. Find a blueprint of the forges layout, find a target ingress, probably points of interest, extraction point and backup plans for when they fail.

Eaones events:

After Kasey's inspections and work, Eaone finds themselves in need of work, and with the rest of their crew heading out they seek safer employment than adventuring, finding a workshop in the Outer City called Ingustus Corp, run by the overseer Gust, A huge muscled Minotaur covered in storied marks of a life of forging.

After letting Eaone prove their worth with the smaller tasks, simple level 1 items and seeing their proficiency, allows them to start working on much harder tasks with more expensive and speific materials, ones Eaone can keep as they hold little use outside the very specific items they're crafting so holding them for bulk would just be hoarding. The few days eaone works, they earn 
25gp and create these items:

After, The Hatter will take their leave, apologising about how short their time together was, and while hes excited to write more from first hand accounts, there are other chapters of this story happening elsewhere that he simply must go see themselves. He refuses to give any information, but the implication is that her saytr, Leanan, seems to be making moves of their own. 

The traveller will show up to catch their ride, and will promise to meet again soon, if nothing else but to show up when things aren't going to hell.

Eaone will get an invitation to meet with Big Dog privately. The conversation will immediately establish that this is not about work of the world but about meeting someone else like him - an isolight species, that wasn't made alongside him.

He will talk about his history, His enlightener, Tellarum, and his three other brothers who were his lifelong friends. How the Archmage enlightened only the ones he could trust to protect him. He was the only survivor after the Bloodstar Assassins hunted him down. 40 assassins attacked the place, only 5 made it out alive after taking Teallrum and his brothers lives. 

He knows them by name. 
Eaksati Afriani
Terrli Holly
Grangi Guts
End the brothers Askri and Entri Perco

They split the bounty of 5 million gold between them. Tellarum had no enemies, he lived alone in a tower deep in the Ebonstar mountains as we all know the superstition of what happens to archmages. 

He knows everything about the, but is bound by code to protect his new crew. He learns what he can, and does what he can, but the Blackstar don't step foot in the Kolective much anymore for him to hunt his vengance.

He'll mention how it seems every Isolight he meets always has a villain in their story, and will prompt Eaone to share their story. He will tell the names of the Paladins that killed his owner and kin. If Eaone mentions their Lich, he will write their name on a sheer and pin it to the wall with a list of other names, including the assassins of Tellarum, and say that he persoanlly will keep Eaone updated if he hears anything, and requests Eaone does in kind. 

The conversation can continue from there as natural, there is no rush to send eaone home.

**Famous Kitsune Biomancer Kacsy** 
Grand antlers protrude from her head, the fox's ears are larger, with her orange/back/white colourisation changed to represent more of an African wild dog with a little more symmetry and styling. She is followed by a massive minotaur women, large for even a large creature who works as her bodyguard. 

Will find the crew with the tip from her patrons about an incredible biomanced creature who's been spotted around the city recently, but upon actually meeting Eaone, they will need a moment and then confirmation to learn that Eaone is an Isolight, and not another creature under heavy biomodding. 

She will apologise and invite Eaone and her crew to visit her salon if they have the time as a massive favour, she would still love to learn Eaones features but understands if the topic and idea of crass.

• Kaelam fortude saves for Arcane Sickness - finally having no threats or events looming over him has him attune to the fact his elemental body has been effectively suffocated from elemental energy and he hasn't had enough time to attune to the mix of everything, but particularly the overwhelming fae arcane that suffuses the air.

The Euphrosyne Incident:

5 Fey hunters, Araveks, water-based execute a plan to track Euphrosyne back to the fey wilds. The effect will be a chain of 5 effects:
• Euphrosyne will feel inclined to look behind her - doing so will see the entire road completely empty (Suggestion)
• Euphrosyne will look back to her friends, who are now also missing - she is alone in the street
• At the end of the street she'll see the silhouette of a familiar satyr. (Phantasmal image)
• A portal is summoned in the street behind Euphrosyne, hidden to her to appear as empty street
• Euphrosyne will feel complete dread at approaching the satyr, and is compelled to run away down the street - into the portal she can't see

If the party can't stop her via magical means, The traveller will appear, grab Euphrosyne by the arm and ask her if she trusts her. Being in a magic-riddled state and confused she won't be able to identify that its the Nexus satyr until she accepts the hell, at which point she'll be cleansed of all magical effects. She'll yell to the party to run, don't get used as a hostage, before taking off herself

#### Nexus
Observer will state how unwise everything they have done with the guild is, stating how much the guild has done for the team and spared them lives that have caused a rift in the chain of command, and in exchange and on the first test of reliance and honesty, have betrayed them within seconds - reconciliation is mandatory, if not just for the continued work of the nexus and their lives. They have every reason to believe you are actually operatives of Elara now, despite the mission being one the guild would have been ecstatic to have helped with




• The crew will at some point be recalled back to The Nexus. by The Observer. They will be in conversation at a meeting table with the Humanoid form of His Majesty and The Traveller, a Saytr 
Feyborn.
> The team will be informed the the Mines bounty has turned from a Mundane expedition to a discovery that may shift the world out of the neutral game the realms and people in power are playing at - it is a powder keg that requires finesse and care to disarm.

> The Traveller believes the ruins contains an active community phylactery containing the souls of a collection of ancient Feyborn and Dragonkin, ancient enough for the celestials can't be allowed to get their hands on it now it's been brought back to light.

> The observer will requests the party ask the guild to take over this bounty and return the soul-gems within the phylactery back to the nexus so they can be returned to their realms. The main issue is that the disconnection of any body from soul will lose it to the celestials, and a soul that ancient will without doubt draw their attention. 

> The issue is that they will probably defend it with their lives, so stealth and defensive moves are highly suggested

> The Observer will grant the crew an Aiskari Shadow-Coin, a mysterious item of untold value to give to the guild to persuade them of this unusual request. - It is weightless and provides no sensory impulses to the holder aside the visual that they are holding it

> • Remember to take Izumi's item to transform into the gift of gab amulet
