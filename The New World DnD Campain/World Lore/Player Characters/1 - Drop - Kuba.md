**Hometown/Dimension:**    Somewhere within a Costal [[Tomebound]] City

**Description:** 


**Backstory:**

• Why an artificer
	Parents are middle-class Tomebound artificers that would let drop have access to a reasonable amount of Tomebound resources and equipment.
	Still working for some upper-class Tomebound person

• What did drop do/find
	Drops Employer has a plan to overtake the entire city
	Drop's role helps create a personal army to achieve the goal, giving him experience in battlesmithing and combat from and intelligence PoV
		Finds out a part of the plan is to """Remove""" people who know the automatons design specs so they can't be countered fast enough to stop the city take-over
		Gets family out of the city, spread rumours and posters about how to deal with the automatons, and then gets the fuck outta there
			Ends up on the Rani ship as it was closets, cheap and available
			Parents probably end up somewhere in the syndicate

• How was drop so willing and able to setup life literally anywhere else
	Was already pretty eager to stat a new new life that wasn't the Tomebound shitholes
	probably the only place in the content he is literally unfindable
	Food, bedding, a job, - what's to complain about

**Primary Campaign Goal:**   Survive? + Damn, this islands fucking interesting huh
