During the [[2. Celestial War Of Mortality]], the Eidolons were the primary target of the celestials and was the battleground of the Battle of Cenundum, where mortal followers of the celestials empowered by their strongest powerful the celestials could muster tried to claim control of the island and the eidolons.
