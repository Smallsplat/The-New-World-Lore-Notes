Asctiatarti Blessing

**Dusaph** will land next to the crew and apologise for the delay, and will offer a tour to the few amenities they have out here. He will go to take off again before realising all the flight based stuff isn't an option before stopping to think on what to do. 

While they do they will meet **Natoroko** (Male Female , **Talisloso** (Drakonid Female)and **Falirino** (Drakonid Centaur Male) who will use Dusaf as an excuse to say hello to the mortals who will suggest places to visit

**Natoroko** a bashful a Drakonid and charged in storage due to their fascination with valuables and items - while combat isnt their thing, the valueables they leave behind and the bounties of the world is their main love.

**Talisloso** is a proud and well-build Drakonid female who knows her worth and will happily spar practice with anything she can - She takes pride in defending the farlands and proving herself stronger than others in every way, but also loves colourful and shiny things

**Falirino** is a flirtatious, joyful yet yet smaller Drakotaur who will always seek the positive and good vibes in anything. They live life to the best and want everyone around them to do so too as long as it doesnt hurt or harsh the vibe.

Locations
**Talisloso** will offer to spar with them because she's always wanted to fight mortals who look like they would float in their air planes. The other two will note how they would enjoy watching but they've been beaten too many times to find joy in it - Falirino wouldnt mind getting to see how the mortals work up close but Natoroko will entierly opt out without any rewards to get

**Falirino** will note about the **hot cycles** they use to relax and bath - This will give Talisoso an opperunity note the garments the crew wears, asking if it was normal for all mortals to wear those even in this heat - Falinario will take any opportunity to flirt but  **Dusaph** notes how that doesn't seem very emotionally in sync with recent events and should only go if the crew want to. 

**Natoroko** will suggest visiting the local Cysrtalirums to see if theres anything of particular value being grown. The other two will call him a massive nerd, at which he'll note that there is dragon racing in the amphitheatre , but that's mostly just watching events rather than doing anything - unless they have anything they wanted to use to gamble on who wins. Falinario will always offer a good time, but may have some more physical objects he'd be willing to part with - as will Talisloso.

Whatever the crew do the event will be Interrupted by a dragon roar and the dragon friends they've made looking on high alert, dropping hat their doing to go sort their heat plating - noting this is an alert for an elemental surge, and given the warning, oddly close to the city. If the crew offer to help we go into combat where the party will fall into the **Ruins of the Asctiatarti Communion**

**Ruins of the Asctiatarti Communion**

The Asctiatarti Communion is a time-lost dragon-church between the Fae Lord Titania and The Dragon Ancient Asctiatarti - it contains:

A gaint statue of the fae Titania with her paramour 

A portal in disrepair, gigantic in nature which runes imply a direct connection to the fae wilds
A huge communion hall, filled with plenty of space for dragons to fly and roost and seating fit for fae. 

The amount of effort made to fit creatures of all kindas here comfortable is asonishing, the sheer amount of ancient furniture that fits centaurs, fawns, fariys, bugbears, crones and all sorts of fary creatures 

The space seems abandoned, not destroyed - yet the rock that covers it seems purposefully placed. This place was hidden and forgotten intentionally.

The dining halls seems more like a suggestion than a grand hall - there arn't enough tables to seat as many people as could fit in the ceremony hall however the sheer amount of arcane residue implies arcane solves a lot of their needs

Huge viewing areas that seem unaccable line the walls - rooms for fragments of the primordial themselves to be in 

---

Titania in the fey wilds isn't real - its a name mocked and taboo to claim for yourself. She's the Tall Tale, the Fey Story, the mortal troublemaker - but here she's being presented as a very real fae lord. Its a part of fae culture that's so baked into its roots that it takes mental effort to not immediately dismiss this as some fae trick 

The party will find themselves able to open magically sealed doors due to their blessing - but will "Spend" the blessing which lets them access items - however its up to them if they take them or not. This includes:

• Evergarden
• Gift Vault
• Dressing Rooms
• Custodial Office
• Private Chambers


Dragon's Virtue (item that lets dragons to bonus to enemies effecting by fae)
Feys Trickery (^ this but opposite)

**Dezshara** will be there, having been a core part of inventing a device that can track portals in the farlands due to rapid elemental shifts. They will be estatic to see kaelam alive and well, and also excited to use and practice their common with mortal folk. They will give kaelam a handful of books - many follow ups 

---
**Dusaph** will meet with the crew in visage form with an arm-full of scrolls of Comprehend language modified to last a reasonable amount of time so they can use draconic to speak - which when translated sounds like very fast common. He will note about how the City Ancient is expecting them to discuss what is going on,


Dragon Elder Tre'ragon will meet with the crew to get their first hand accounts on what they have learned and their ties to Elara - they will learn that the party is from what nthey know - a big part of the tomebound story of Elaras plot is how they are a part of Elara's escape, how Elara and his closest allies are outlaws to diswade others joining their cause

The issue is that if the party is telling the truth, we don't know how effective this branch of propaganda is at keeping Elaras support low within the tomebound. He will convene with the other ancients to discuss everything they know and work out how to move forward - however, fundamentally, they are still outsiders to the elemental realms and are Dusaph's responsibility.

The team are given leave as the ancient takes off towards the origin as Dusaph shrugs and offers them a proper tour of the city now that they're at least trusted enough to not be Elaras agents in the city.

Unlike the citys of mortals, the cities in the fire realms are mostly accommodations and utilitarian - as dragon bodies are incredibly resistant and can feed of the ambient energy food places are limited, and a lack of many basic needs and the community welfare for the flight makes stores non-existent. The few buildings of note are community spaces, luxuries and funcational buildings - Hangout locations, places to relax - scientists and warehouses. 

Many more dragons will be curious about our mortal parties with those who they meet talking about:
• What its like to have scales
• Do kin care about kin in the same way dragon flights work?
• What's eating like?

Dragon Elder Tre'ragon will bring council to the party when it feels fitting, and will discuss and address the party and hear their story. witha  heavy heart he will have to banish kealam to keep the tomebound peace, too much is at stake. He will report the discoverys to the other elders  of the other realms, and confront the tomebound of the lies and why they stand. 

Charlie will arrive with a portal opened by magiscale to collect the crew after scout informed the guild about whats happening, ending up on a tiny island as close to the timebound as possible, at which they will vibe on the quiet, serene beach together

### Heist

Commanding Wizard Ananke

Wizards report to the commanding wizard upon any event of note. 

Worker automatons are working the forge, however don't respond to stimuli unless directly hacked or controlled via console. 

Most wizards are there entirely for security and force, with a few notable exceptions:
> Portal ritualists - These wizards don't rotate and their main role is to ritually open a runed portal to cycle wizards in and out. 
> Outpost Managers - Most of their spells are set for restoring and maintaining the cult. The creation of food, the healing of injuries, the curing of blights. 
> Obelisk Surveyors - More important wizards who actively balance the obelisks creation. 

The wizards main objective is to keep the forge running, this requires:
• Keeping all wildlife out of the forge
• Reporting Automaton mishaps
• Ensuring no opportunists try something

#### Loot:
Resources:
> Oblilum - An arcane compound of obsidian and Djezet, only able to be forged with the pure elemental arcane energy of the fire realm unbound, it alone is a powerful arcane conductor, but if often attuned to a particular realm of magic to heighten its already potent effects
> > Grants a +1 item bonus to spell DC when forged into a spell focus and your spells are heightened as if you were 1 level higher
> > • This effect is doubled for a specific magic type if attuned to it, attunement must be done Immediately after the forging process in the presence of its layline
> > When used as a spell focus by a caster within a ritual, the caster counts as two people

> Around 150GP of arcane ingredients used in alchemy and as spell components 

Ananke has a [Diplomat's Badge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3078) and [Pristine Epaulets](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3975)

#### Notes

• Operation details:
> • Run the obelisk forges to create smaller obelisks, strong enough to replace a spellcaster in a ritual spell but small enough to not give away their main operations
> • All cultists must be on guard for Automaton tampering and opportunistic parties in the Tomebound Wilderness - All wildlife should be dealt with accordingly.
> • Forces will be rotated regularly to familiarise themselves with the Right Hands and to prevent giving groups enough time to form smaller unions 

• Smaller details
> • All cult members have Soul Crystals that entrap their souls on death so that they can be revived for their loyalty upon Elara's Enlightenment
> • Automatons are not to be touched aside by dedicated specialists - anyone found tampering with them are traitors and dealt with accordingly
> • A few notes of conversations talk about a "Location E", a seeming point of importance that has been kept top secret and talked about only in code

• Research notes by Ananke
The soul crystals we were given versus the rest of these wizards are subtly different to a trained eye. They are reluctant to give them to me for study as they believe if it their lifeline - a tool that lets them fight without fear, and yet... I have full faith theirs do not work. By all my estimations mine will, but these lowborn rabble will perish a permanent death. A lot of work has been put into making it look real though.

Elara has not informed them or us, and I assume it is intentional. They are infested with the blights that plagues our nation, they will die for a cause that will wipe them away none the less. We will make a better world.

#### Events:

• The players will be followed by deer that don't seem as skittish as they should be
> Reveals to be nearby druids who are trying to sus out if the crew is part of whatevers going on at the forge
> Will offer shelter, food and a safe place to rest if they can help them find an elusive creature a - Mokele
> The druids are trying to find its lair to study it and add it to their circles collection of wildshapes

The druids circle is a mystical grove deep into the Tomebound wilderness, filled with creatures that are, upon deeper inspection, just druids who pride themselves in their realism and precision 







Amathist meeting:
• Elysia is there to oversee the operation being generally unhappy about everything
• Tyreen is there so act as a spellcaster for the team to teleport them into the tomebound with her fox familiar
• Eesk, a Kobold is there to give the team a bomb to destroy the obelisk. The device when made looks scrapped together, but upon a closer look it's just an incredibly efficient.

The objective:

They will be teleported via portal nearby the obelisk forge. Their goal is to discover as much information as they can and sabotage the forge. The explosive device must be put directly on the obelisk, at which the team has 5 minutes to clear the area. Staying undiscovered is ideal but mostly for personal saftey - while they expect most of the wizards would be no match for the party as most Tomebound wizards aren't built for combat, the sheer number of them may overwhelm the party. 

They expect that they have been using the obelisk forges as an outpost too, so information, documentation, artifacts and similar items are high value and as much should be extracted as possible before detonation.

The party is tasked to get ready for the mission - both with equipment and information on the objective. They should assume they are going in with the need to quietly remove and defend themselves from many spellcasters. Silent communication, ways to move around without being detected, a way to clear the blast zone when they're done. Find a blueprint of the forges layout, find a target ingress, probably points of interest, extraction point and backup plans for when they fail.

Eaones events:

After Kasey's inspections and work, Eaone finds themselves in need of work, and with the rest of their crew heading out they seek safer employment than adventuring, finding a workshop in the Outer City called Ingustus Corp, run by the overseer Gust, A huge muscled Minotaur covered in storied marks of a life of forging.

After letting Eaone prove their worth with the smaller tasks, simple level 1 items and seeing their proficiency, allows them to start working on much harder tasks with more expensive and speific materials, ones Eaone can keep as they hold little use outside the very specific items they're crafting so holding them for bulk would just be hoarding. The few days eaone works, they earn 
25gp and create these items:

After, The Hatter will take their leave, apologising about how short their time together was, and while hes excited to write more from first hand accounts, there are other chapters of this story happening elsewhere that he simply must go see themselves. He refuses to give any information, but the implication is that her saytr, Leanan, seems to be making moves of their own. 

The traveller will show up to catch their ride, and will promise to meet again soon, if nothing else but to show up when things aren't going to hell. 

--- 
Eaone will get an invitation to meet with Big Dog privately. The conversation will immediately establish that this is not about work of the world but about meeting someone else like him - an isolight species, that wasn't made alongside him.

He will talk about his history, His enlightener, Tellarum, and his three other brothers who were his lifelong friends. How the Archmage enlightened only the ones he could trust to protect him. He was the only survivor after the Bloodstar Assassins hunted him down. 40 assassins attacked the place, only 5 made it out alive after taking Teallrum and his brothers lives. 

He knows them by name. 
Eaksati Afriani
Terrli Holly
Grangi Guts
End the brothers Askri and Entri Perco

They split the bounty of 5 million gold between them. Tellarum had no enemies, he lived alone in a tower deep in the Ebonstar mountains as we all know the superstition of what happens to archmages. 

He knows everything about the, but is bound by code to protect his new crew. He learns what he can, and does what he can, but the Blackstar don't step foot in the Kolective much anymore for him to hunt his vengance.

He'll mention how it seems every Isolight he meets always has a villain in their story, and will prompt Eaone to share their story. He will tell the names of the Paladins that killed his owner and kin. If Eaone mentions their Lich, he will write their name on a sheer and pin it to the wall with a list of other names, including the assassins of Tellarum, and say that he persoanlly will keep Eaone updated if he hears anything, and requests Eaone does in kind. 

The conversation can continue from there as natural, there is no rush to send eaone home.

**Famous Kitsune Biomancer Kacsy** 
Grand antlers protrude from her head, the fox's ears are larger, with her orange/back/white colourisation changed to represent more of an African wild dog with a little more symmetry and styling. She is followed by a massive minotaur women, large for even a large creature who works as her bodyguard. 

Will find the crew with the tip from her patrons about an incredible biomanced creature who's been spotted around the city recently, but upon actually meeting Eaone, they will need a moment and then confirmation to learn that Eaone is an Isolight, and not another creature under heavy biomodding. 

She will apologise and invite Eaone and her crew to visit her salon if they have the time as a massive favour, she would still love to learn Eaones features but understands if the topic and idea of crass.

• Kaelam fortude saves for Arcane Sickness - finally having no threats or events looming over him has him attune to the fact his elemental body has been effectively suffocated from elemental energy and he hasn't had enough time to attune to the mix of everything, but particularly the overwhelming fae arcane that suffuses the air.

The Euphrosyne Incident:

5 Fey hunters, Araveks, water-based execute a plan to track Euphrosyne back to the fey wilds. The effect will be a chain of 5 effects:
• Euphrosyne will feel inclined to look behind her - doing so will see the entire road completely empty (Suggestion)
• Euphrosyne will look back to her friends, who are now also missing - she is alone in the street
• At the end of the street she'll see the silhouette of a familiar satyr. (Phantasmal image)
• A portal is summoned in the street behind Euphrosyne, hidden to her to appear as empty street
• Euphrosyne will feel complete dread at approaching the satyr, and is compelled to run away down the street - into the portal she can't see

If the party can't stop her via magical means, The traveller will appear, grab Euphrosyne by the arm and ask her if she trusts her. Being in a magic-riddled state and confused she won't be able to identify that its the Nexus satyr until she accepts the hell, at which point she'll be cleansed of all magical effects. She'll yell to the party to run, don't get used as a hostage, before taking off herself

#### Nexus
Observer will state how unwise everything they have done with the guild is, stating how much the guild has done for the team and spared them lives that have caused a rift in the chain of command, and in exchange and on the first test of reliance and honesty, have betrayed them within seconds - reconciliation is mandatory, if not just for the continued work of the nexus and their lives. They have every reason to believe you are actually operatives of Elara now, despite the mission being one the guild would have been ecstatic to have helped with




• The crew will at some point be recalled back to The Nexus. by The Observer. They will be in conversation at a meeting table with the Humanoid form of His Majesty and The Traveller, a Saytr 
Feyborn.

> The Traveller believes the ruins contains an active community phylactery containing the souls of a collection of ancient Feyborn and Dragonkin, ancient enough for the celestials can't be allowed to get their hands on it now it's been brought back to light.

> The observer will requests the party ask the guild to take over this bounty and return the soul-gems within the phylactery back to the nexus so they can be returned to their realms. The main issue is that the disconnection of any body from soul will lose it to the celestials, and a soul that ancient will without doubt draw their attention. 

> The issue is that they will probably defend it with their lives, so stealth and defensive moves are highly suggested

> The Observer will grant the crew an Aiskari Shadow-Coin, a mysterious item of untold value to give to the guild to persuade them of this unusual request. - It is weightless and provides no sensory impulses to the holder aside the visual that they are holding it

> • Remember to take Izumi's item to transform into the gift of gab amulet

# The Guild

• Amathist will be annoyed as ususal, the guild will grant the team the Handler, Scout - A Bluebird Tengu semi-permanently - which will grant them access to the guild resources on command in exchange for the guild learning everything they see and do while on guild buisness.
