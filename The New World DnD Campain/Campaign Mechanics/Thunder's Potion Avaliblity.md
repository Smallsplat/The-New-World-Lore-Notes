Thunder restocks potions at the start of each day equal to the restock list, unless she has reached the capacity of those potions she stores. Her stores are used by both squads, and any potions one squad takes the other can't access. 

Potions of Rare value or higher will have a Recharge dice roll. If any are in Stock, there's a chance an NPC will take the potion if left unclaimed, with a higher chance for rarer potions.
