#Kolective 
A stuck-up snob of an elf who's suspicious of everyone and everything. While he gets fed the same information as the other envoys he often uses his spellcraft to try and force his way into knowing information subtly with subtle spells and detect thoughts.

He dresses in an opulent and long flowing blue robe gilded in runed gold around the cuffs and buttons mined with gemstones. His long flowing hair is tied back and he stands with a straight back with a sense of nobility and wealth.  

He sees this squabble over the island to be beneath him but forces himself to partake in the diplomacy of trying to convince the others that they have a right to at least find the layline. The potential that people smarter than anyone else on the island combine could utilise this magic and create something impossible that would be lost should the common mage tap into this font.
