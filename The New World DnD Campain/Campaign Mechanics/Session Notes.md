## General Notes - Session 1

Both squads have arrived at the New World and have been given the Tour of Outpost Skyrise! Arriving by Wingdrake or Boat, they were greeted on landing by Commander Highturner and Amathist, the officers of the Outpost, and given a tour of the settlement.  
  
They met the Blacksmith Ironbeard, the hulking tiefling that commands the smithies and offered to use the resources and opportunities the roamers find out in the island to create new, custom gear. In the tavern is the Half-elf  Mother Tyreen and her Kobolods, supplying the outpost with daily meals, and has requested to hunt for other edibles out on the island to expand her catering options. And in the lower levels of the Infocade, Professor Magiscale, the lizardkin and an eccentric ball of scales obsessed with hoarding knowledge has offered to share his collection to help the roamers on their escapades.

Their tour ended with meeting the Envoys of all three major empires, the Kolective represented by the calm and collected Minotaur Elysia, the Syndicate represented by upbeat Teifling Vaelin, and the Tomebound represented by a tall, untalkative elf.  

Their dismissal and privacy of the envoys let the officers Amathyst and Highcommander be blunt about the stakes of this expedition. Wars over territory are frequent and repetitive over the long course of history, and he expects this island to be no different. It just takes a missive from an empire and a few quick assassinations for a full-scale war to break out, thousands of lives to be lost on the battlefield and the secrets this island lost to pillaging and looting. 

This also raised the point of the previous roamers, who disappeared without a trace, and in turn employed the presence of the Guides, Charlie and Scotch, whose sole responsibility is to note take and keep track of the roamer's locations in case of emergencies so an entire party of people don’t disappear off the map... again…

## General Notes - Session 2

After the briefing, both squads were dismissed for the day to rest and prepare for their roam tomorrow. The Saturday squad chose the Brevacus, an oversized beaver, whereas the Sunday crew are on the hunt for the Hedgehog, a chunky spikey hedgehog! 

Seeking advice from the officers, both squads sought out Professor Magiscale to do some initial planning and to better know their quarries, both with reasonable success. One squad found themselves trading for information and seeking out the professor's assistance in exploring their combat prowess, while the others sought out the blacksmiths to discover ways to capture the beasts.

A major direction split was how the parties got to know each other. While the Saturday squad used a regenerating plant dummy to shoot and showcase their spells and Combat abilities, the Sunday squad used each other's bodies. While the Saturday squad used a signature ability to showcase their fighting style, the Sunday squad blinded, shot, coerced, used biochemical warfare and transformed their way into a beat down for the grand prize of… choosing who picks beds first! 

This brawl ended with Keth victorious, who attacked nobody in the battle and healed their way to first place, choosing the closest bed at the time, while Shuvu came last, who did well in the battle but could not convince the others she was actually as okay as she was. Meanwhile, the Saturday squad were bonding over ice sculptures, scouting the views and discussing their thoughts on the other denizens of the outpost before both squads finally bedded for the night.

## General Notes - Session 3

These sessions were fairly similar, with both squads getting equipped with the flair gun, a days worth of food and the scrying rings, each talking to their appropriate person twho would have each tool. After being officially dismissed by the Officers, the Sunday squad ran into ELysra, the Mintoraur Envoy of the Kolective, who joined them having nothing better to do and just generally excited about things starting again to collect the sleep bombs and walked them to the gate.  
  
While saturdays squad stops here, the Sunday squad went out of their hunt! Learning about the plains and tracking down the Brevacus to its lair, a forest’s graveyard of sawdust and fallen trees, and while they were far from stealthy in their approach, a Natural 1 saw the breavacus fast asleep, unaware of their presence, letting them get the jump in the upcoming battle…

## General Notes - Session 4

The Saturday squad found themselves up against the Breavacus and, to be blunt, kicked its ass. Getting the jump on the boy and getting a free round let them split up against the beast’s attacks, who was forced to choose one or the other. Hills wings allowing flight helped navigate this wooden graveyard of a battlefield and shut the Breavacus down before its ability to turn trees into breath attacks could do some serious damage with a well-placed magic sleep bomb. 

On the other hand, the Sunday squad used Locate Animal and Plants and walked in a straight line to their hunt, using Felis’s ability to transform into different beats to climb a sheer cliff face using a spider web, much to Kurt's general disgust and desire to find a way to just use a rope. The actual battle was a lot tenser, with the Hedgebog getting the jump on the group with Shuvu’s constitution finding themselves seeing quadruple and nearly falling in battle, and the Hedgebog using its quills to try and defend itself, and was also captured.

The squad's attention post-battle took different approaches. As Hill and Dandelion scoured the area for clues or loot, and stumbled upon a ruined abandoned toll building. Anything that could rot, had, and the entire building had mostly been claimed by nature. In turn, a toll building tolls a road, and a clear pathway cut through the forest leads north, where, after re-grouping with Thalina and a natural 20, 4 figures were spotted for a brief moment.

While Kurt and Felis scoured for additional traps laid by the hedgehog, Shuvu and Keth in turn looked into the beasts themselves, and with another natural 20, attuned to the beast's arcana and were washed with this alien and unnatural feeling arcana from any realm they know…

## General Notes - Session 5

(Session 4 stuff I missed) The Saturday squad had arrived at the outpost hours before the Sunday squad and debriefed with the officers, informing the outpost of the other figures and triggering a headcount and announcement, with everyone grouping at the Infocade. Dismissed for the night, they settled down for bed before being distracted by Thalina and her wing-drakes taking off to go collect the other squad.  
  
(Session 5 actual) United, the two squads discussed pleasantries, greetings, and sharing some inside jokes before heading up the infocade to meet with their guides. After an incredibly rough and wild explanation of their hunts, the guides gave a rundown of all the new information, along with trying to reinforce faith in the outpost, despite the seeming chaos that spawned after their hunts on their second day here. 

---

Suggesting a rest, the squad let the guides brief the officers, stole Mother Tyreen and took off to the tavern, where they ran into Magiscale studying the beasts. Hill, Dandelion and Keth stayed to discuss while the rest got grub, where Keth raised the comment about the beast not feeling from Ji’kuth as a whole and feeling… alien, and, after the discussion about magic in general and a second attempt with better guidance, Hill also clued into the alien-feeling arcana.

This meeting of the minds changed to a sharp tonal change as Dandelion insulted Magiscale, who became visibly upset, and the other members' attempts to reconcile with the wizard failed, the discussion ending as he politely suggested they left for food. Mother Tyreen, showing why she earned that title, clued into the party’s general distress immediately and did her best to help them work through it.  

A night later, fully rested and with a belly full of breakfast, our adventures joined in an argument between the Amathyst and Magiscale about what to do with the beasts. Magiscale insisted on trying and banishing the creatures to prove his theory that “Luminae”, a realm entirely from children's fiction, actually exists and these beats came here, despite refusing to explain his reasoning outside “A departed friend research”, whereas Amathyst wanted to release the beasts back into the wilds like any reasonable person.

After discussion, Magiscale attempted a banishment spell, which failed outright… so he cast it as a much, much higher level successfully! The beast permanently disappeared, confirming the theory that they are not from this realm, but, their general resistance to being banished made Magiscale concerned about tracking where they got banished to, and thus the hedgehog remained in camp for additional research.

Ironbeard, wondering what caused the roamer's delay and not wanting to cause even more of a fuss, stole our squad members away from this to talk upgrades based on what they could salvage from the beasts. After a long discussion about utility and benefits was about to conclude, a wave of raw arcana rushed through the camp, the smithies flames engulfing the players… and ending the session

## General Notes - Session 6

The aftermath of the arcane blast split our parties again. While both squads helped try to deduce the source arcane wave, the approach to the situation’s urgency was starkly different. The Sunday squad took their time to recuperate, speculate and research both the source and their next steps. The Saturday squad on the other hand were all hands on deck, ensuring everyone's safety and went straight to be briefed.

Both squads were assigned to scour the island coasts. With the news of there being other people on the island, the officers assigned the roamers to scout the coastlines of the southern isle. Due to the sheer distance of the isle from any other landmass, a vessel of some sort must have been used to land on the island, and the roamers’ job is to find it.

Saturday squad in their haste headed straight to the western coastline, but embarked on a slight detour when the sounds of a turf war between two greater beasts was overheard… where they found mightier beasts in the woods than they expected…

## General Notes - Session 7

After surviving their encounter deep in the woods, the saturday squad caught their breath before heading to their starting point. Before they could even get there however, a loud crash ocean side would take full attention. A cargo ship had ruptured and crashed into shore, with people in full plate scrambling to escape the tide. Upon rushing out to help, the party was suddenly attacked… but a stowaway onboard helped defend the party! This brutal fight saw Kurt fall but ended victorious, the paladins killed, and the stowaway, a Kenku called Drop, spared and recruited to the party until the officers decide their fate.

The sunday squad, equipped for their adventure, took to the eastern cliffs. Enhanced by Felis’s ability to transform to move at double speed, they managed to reach the start of their search border with full daylight. The thin cliff path lead them to finding and tracking down a large, currently unnamed lizard, with the ability to call for reinforcmenets! After it nearly killed Shuvu and a heavy amount of panic, some well placed blows to knocked the beast and its companions out.

## General Notes - Session 8

With time to burn until sundown, the Saturday crew work together to settle in the remains of the ship. A campfire was made, a makeshift rope navigate the ship floors and the local crates looted, the Woodcutter daggers forged from the teeth of the breavacus making it light work. Discovering a strange tablet depicting symbols of the 5 planes of structure and a Statue of the Godess Rani, the crew settle down around the campfire and connect before a well-deserved rest. 

After a short rest to nurse their wounds, the sunday squad continues their scout of the eastern cliffline. The clear waves and windswept cliffs proved very little interest outside of its natural beauty, until a small, hidden cave revealed a small bounty of unique berries! After scouring for additional supplies to last the night, a sudden surprise visit from a familiar face left the night with many questions and even more confusion.

## General Notes - Session 9

A new dawn saw the squads continue their adventures, with the Saturday crew scrounging up any last supplies from the shipwreck, and the Sunday crew enjoying the calming cliffs and open sea on the outer edges on this wild isle, interrupted by an early monring conversation with their guides, sharing news about the events back at base.

The news of the Rani paladin attacks, claiming the Staurday squad of being assistan to the crimes of the Archmage Maliketh, was quickly overshadowed by the introduction of a Second Magiscale who claimed to be from “A different dimension” who was adamant about the basecamp’s magiscale not knowing about them… which Charlie immediately broke. This lead to Elara, The Tomebound envoy immediately starting an argument with Commander Highturner about Magiscale clearly breaching the outpost rules.

This caused the guides to be split apart and put into the envoys offices while the observation deck is used to have an official discussion with all the guides while our adventuerors continue their scouting. It was the saturdays squad to find some unique plants, only to reliase too late it was being used as bait for some crafty beasts, leading to a brutal fight where they came so close to losing one of their own. Sunday crew, however, had a fairly uneventful morning, mostly interrupted by any updates charlie could find and a rather toxic plant.
