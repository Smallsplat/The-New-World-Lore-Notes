# Restockables
#### Poison Sleep Bomb
The bomb must take at least 4 damage directly to break open or be prepared with a bonus action. Upon exploding, a noxious gas coats all creatures 5ft around the point of impact, effected by a 5d8 sleep (poison) effect. 

This poison affects the target as a “Sleep Threshold”. If this Sleep Threshold is higher than the creature's hit points at the end of their turn, at the end of their next turn they will fall unconscious for 24 hours unless cured. Every turn the threshold halves until it’s less than 8 or the creature falls asleep, where it decays entirely.

#### Magic Sleep Bomb
The bomb must take at least 4 damage directly to break open or be prepared with a bonus action. Upon exploding, a noxious gas coats all creatures 5ft around the point of impact, affected by a 3d8 sleep (poison) effect. If this Sleep Threshold is higher than the creature's hit points at the start of their turn, they will fall unconscious for 24 hours unless cured.
