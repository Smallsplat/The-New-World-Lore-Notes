The Syndicate, born from a humble town inhabited by retired, injured, or unfit-for-duty pirates, stands as one of the world's most diverse empires. Its pirate roots dig deep with the motives of freedom, wealth and resources, each baked into the country’s core values. Syndicate merchants have gained a reputation for their unparalleled ability to acquire or create any commodity or service for the right price.

Within this society, an individual's status hinges on their prowess in resource creation or trade. The artisans who craft the highest-quality goods or procure the rarest items, alongside the merchants who have the privilege of selling such coveted wares, ascend to the upper echelons of the rapidly evolving social hierarchy. In contrast, sabotage is deemed the most heinous crime, often carrying a penalty of death, with all assets belonging to the saboteur forfeited to the victim, as the destruction of resources, even in pursuit of greater value, is regarded as the gravest sin.

They want the island as it’s a major central location that would create the biggest and most powerful trading hub ever seen. The isle’s new bounty of never-seen resources, artefacts, and treasures are just benefits compared to its locational value. Having a central point in the northern hemisphere that is a day's sail away from most major ports would bring untold bounties to the Ebonstar Syndicate, and those within it.
