### Overview:

Home of the Red Spider-lily, these missing isles seem to be entirely lost to time - the only reason we know they existed was due to Izumi's dreams and forgotten journals. 

In Izumi's Dreamwalks, all we've seen of the isle is an understanding that there was some sort of civilisation or settlement on the isle - seemingly occupied by four clans that were seeking enlightenment until the celestial's rise to godhood.

Right now, it's the staging ground for Izumi's training, but the last we know about this isle is that the divine utterly obliterated it to the point that the ocean split around its crater for weeks. However, its preservation seems very real in the dream.
