A proud, tall and well built Red Dragonborn who puts Clan over everything. They are dressed in a long, flowing robe that’s tied at their waist and gets lifted by their long tail whenever they get too excited to contain their emotions along with a flowing chestwrap that rests over their sholders. 

Unlike typical Dragonborn, Charlie has an incredibly smooth structure with a notable lack of frills and spikes outside their long grand horns and takes pride in it. Their red scales are interrupted with a whiteish-cream pattern that flows around their jaw and continues down their front and up around the underside of the tail, which is just as smooth as the rest of their body. 

They were stolen from their clan before hatching and were rescued too far and too late to find out who their original clan was and in turn grew up in the guild. They learned about Dragonborn clan culture and wore it with pride, however struggled to stay with a group long enough to bond. After the guild calls for Handlers to go to the new world, they take up the job immediately and hope to protect their new clan.
